      "desc": "A youthful figure in the robe of a magician, having the countenance of divine Apollo, with smile of confidence and shining eyes. Above his head is the mysterious sign of the Holy Spirit, the sign of life, like an endless cord, forming the figure 8 in a horizontal position . About his waist is a serpent-cincture, the serpent appearing to devour its own tail. This is familiar to most as a conventional symbol of eternity, but here it indicates more especially the eternity of attainment in the spirit. In the Magician's right hand is a wand raised towards heaven, while the left hand is pointing to the earth. This dual sign is known in very high grades of the Instituted Mysteries; it shews the descent of grace, virtue and light, drawn from things above and derived to things below. The suggestion throughout is therefore the possession and communication of the Powers and Gifts of the Spirit. On the table in front of the Magician are the symbols of the four Tarot suits, signifying the elements of natural life, which lie like counters before the adept, and he adapts them as he wills. Beneath are roses and lilies, the flos campi and lilium convallium, changed into garden flowers, to shew the culture of aspiration. This card signifies the divine motive in man, reflecting God, the will in the liberation of its union with that which is above. It is also the unity of individual being on all planes, and in a very high sense it is thought, in the fixation thereof. With further reference to what I have called the sign of life and its connexion with the number 8, it may be remembered that Christian Gnosticism speaks of rebirth in Christ as a change \"unto the Ogdoad.\" The mystic number is termed Jerusalem above, the Land flowing with Milk and Honey, the Holy Spirit and the Land of the Lord. According to Martinism, 8 is the number of Christ.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "You've drawn The Magician upright... a rare and potent sign. It speaks of self-confidence, subtlety, and willpower... qualities ready to surge within you. The wand pointing skyward and finger to the earth reminds us that you are a channel between idea and reality. The tools of creation lie before you... are you ready to wield them?",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Magician arrives reversed... a warning cloaked in charm. It hints at disquiet, mental unrest, and even disgrace, echoing the serpent-cincture's warning of energy turned inward. The infinity sign above his head flickers... have you lost touch with your greater potential, or is someone distorting your vision?",
      "interpretation_up_past": "You once stood at the edge of limitless potential. Back then, your resourcefulness and charm opened doors that others didn't even see. You've shaped moments with sheer willpower and subtle intuition.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, you hold all the tools you need to shape your path. But are you actively using them? Your influence is stronger than you think... trust in your skill and speak with clarity.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "Ahead of you lies a chance to manifest something truly powerful. The moment will call for precision, focus, and belief in your unique voice. Magic is not illusion... it's alignment.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "There was a time when your talents may have been used for control or manipulation... whether by you or someone else. That chapter still lingers, a quiet lesson in intent.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "You might be doubting your abilities or relying too heavily on appearances. There's misalignment between your desire and your execution. Take a breath... reconnect with purpose.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "If you're not careful, someone may try to steer your vision for their own gain. Don't hand over your will. The trickster walks ahead... recognize them, or risk losing your way.",
      "love_up_past": "I feel the pull of an old connection... like sparks from a time when charm and desire shaped something magical. In love, The Magician upright shows that you once cast quite the spell... subtle actions, bold confidence, and timing worked in your favor. You were magnetic... and they felt it.",
      "love_up_present": "There's a strong tug toward matters of the heart right now. Someone may be watching, listening, hoping. The Magician's energy here speaks of potential... if you trust in your voice and authenticity, a connection may deepen into something rare and real.",
      "love_up_future": "Love is forming in the distance... I can feel its warmth. The Magician's presence hints that you'll have the power to manifest something deeply mutual. All it takes is clarity... and the courage to show your heart before it's too late.",
      "love_rev_past": "There's a lingering emotional imprint from a time when love was less than honest. My sense draws me to a moment where trust faltered... and someone's intentions may have been blurred. The Magician reversed here warns of charm used as a mask rather than a bridge.",
      "love_rev_present": "Something feels off in your love life right now. The reversed Magician whispers of misalignment... perhaps someone is wearing a persona... or maybe you are. The real connection won't happen until honesty leads the way.",
      "love_rev_future": "There's an upcoming shift in your romantic path, but it won't come without caution. A charming figure may cross your path soon... but The Magician reversed warns that illusion could be at play. Stay grounded in what feels real, not just what looks enticing.",
      "career_up_past": "Your past actions in work or business stand out... I'm drawn to a memory of initiative... when you took the reins and something shifted. The Magician upright here shows that you once carved success out of raw skill and self-belief.",
      "career_up_present": "I feel energy building in your professional sphere. Your talents are speaking for you... and the time is ripe to take a bold move. Whether it's a pitch, application, or fresh project... The Magician says now is the moment to act with mastery.",
      "career_up_future": "Your career is calling... something big is approaching. I sense a challenge ahead, one that will require creative control and a clear voice. The Magician upright tells me you're ready to lead... if you step up and believe in your own influence.",
      "career_rev_past": "There's something unresolved in your career history... a missed opportunity, a project that slipped through the cracks... or trust that was misplaced. The reversed Magician here shows the result of unclear intentions or overconfidence that led you off-track.",
      "career_rev_present": "The energy around your current job feels unstable... I sense hesitation, or perhaps a fa√ßade being kept up. The Magician reversed warns that something is not what it seems... take a closer look at roles, promises, or your own expectations.",
      "career_rev_future": "There's a decision ahead... but be careful. A path may be tempting in title or appearance, yet empty underneath. The reversed Magician urges caution... align your next step with real purpose, not just what looks good on paper.",
      "finances_up_past": "I'm picking up a memory of financial clarity... a time when you made something out of very little. The Magician upright points to a past where your clever thinking, not luck, helped you make wise choices with money.",
      "finances_up_present": "Money energy is stirring... and I feel that you're sitting on an opportunity. The Magician's upright light shines here... signaling it's time to act with intention. Budget, invest, or negotiate. Your mind is your wealth right now.",
      "finances_up_future": "A chance to improve your financial situation is approaching... I feel it strongly. But it will require precision, not guesswork. The Magician tells you to be intentional... there's prosperity, but only if you're bold and focused.",
      "finances_rev_past": "There's a shadow in your financial past... a mistake or missed truth around money that still echoes. The Magician reversed says someone may have played tricks... or you trusted too quickly. The lesson lingers for a reason.",
      "finances_rev_present": "I sense confusion in your current finances... like numbers don't quite match the feeling in your gut. The Magician reversed warns: don't be dazzled by fast money or smooth talk. Read the fine print... and trust your instincts.",
      "finances_rev_future": "The future holds a fork in your financial road. One path is easy but hollow, the other harder but true. I sense a strong need for discernment. The Magician reversed cautions: don't trade stability for flash. Choose grounded action.",
      "feelings_up_past": "You've known emotional strength... I feel it in a moment where you expressed yourself with honesty and grace. The Magician upright here reminds us that the past offered growth through emotional clarity... you were in sync with your heart.",
      "feelings_up_present": "There's something stirring deep inside you. Right now, you may feel more in tune with your emotional truth than ever before. The Magician's presence says... speak from the heart. Others are ready to hear it.",
      "feelings_up_future": "I sense a rising tide of emotional intelligence on your path. Soon, you'll understand something you've long buried. The Magician encourages you to channel these feelings into words... or art... or truth.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "You've carried emotional confusion from the past... I feel it clearly. The Magician reversed points to a time when feelings were suppressed, misunderstood, or even used as leverage. That old wound still wants healing.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "Something isn't sitting right emotionally. You may feel distant from your own heart... or like you're performing instead of expressing. The Magician reversed whispers... come back to yourself. You don't need to fake control.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "Emotional tests are ahead. I sense the temptation to avoid vulnerability... but it won't serve you. The Magician reversed reminds you that clarity comes from feeling, not hiding. Let the walls soften.",
      "actions_up_past": "You once made a choice that shifted everything. I feel the imprint of a bold move... one that set real change into motion. The Magician upright here honors that... it was not luck, it was will.",

      "actions_up_future": "You'll soon be called to take decisive action. I feel it building already. The Magician says your hands can shape what comes next... but only if you rise to meet the moment with truth and confidence.",
      "actions_rev_past": "There's a past moment where you acted from ego... or fear... or haste. The Magician reversed says that move held consequences... but also left wisdom behind. Learn from it.",
      "actions_rev_present": "Right now, you may feel pushed to act... but the energy isn't aligned. The Magician reversed warns you... a wrong move could complicate things. Take a breath. Choose with clarity.",
      "actions_rev_future": "Soon, the temptation to rush or manipulate an outcome may arise. I sense it clearly. The Magician reversed cautions... wait until your intent and your path are one. Otherwise, you risk undoing your own progress."

      "meaning_rev": "Passion, moral or physical ardour, conceit, surface knowledge.",
      "desc": "She has the lunar crescent at her feet, a horned diadem on her head, with a globe in the middle place, and a large solar cross on her breast. The scroll in her hands is inscribed with the word Tora, signifying the Greater Law, the Secret Law and the second sense of the Word. It is partly covered by her mantle, to shew that some things are implied and some spoken. She is seated between the white and black pillars--J. and B.--of the mystic Temple, and the veil of the Temple is behind her: it is embroidered with palms and pomegranates. The vestments are flowing and gauzy, and the mantle suggests light--a shimmering radiance. She has been called occult Science on the threshold of the Sanctuary of Isis, but she is really the Secret Church, the House which is of God and man. She represents also the Second Marriage of the Prince who is no longer of this world; she is the spiritual Bride and Mother, the daughter of the stars and the Higher Garden of Eden. She is, in fine, the Queen of the borrowed light, but this is the light of all. She is the Moon nourished by the milk of the Supernal Mother.\nIn a manner, she is also the Supernal Mother herself--that is to say, she is the bright reflection. It is in this sense of reflection that her truest and highest name in bolism is Shekinah--the co-habiting glory. According to Kabalism, there is a Shekinah both above and below. In the superior world it is called Binah, the Supernal Understanding which reflects to the emanations that are beneath. In the lower world it is MaIkuth--that world being, for this purpose, understood as a blessed Kingdom that with which it is made blessed being the Indwelling Glory. Mystically speaking, the Shekinah is the Spiritual Bride of the just man, and when he reads the Law she gives the Divine meaning. There are some respects in which this card is the highest and holiest of the Greater Arcana.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The High Priestess reveals herself in your reading... how fortunate, for her appearance upright is rare and rich with meaning. This card speaks of secrets, wisdom, and unseen forces quietly guiding your path. Her presence... seated between the twin pillars with the scroll of hidden law... signals that intuition and stillness hold more power than you realize.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "You've drawn The High Priestess reversed... and the air shifts. This is not a sign of disaster, but a call to caution. Her usual grace is tangled now... passion, conceit, and shallow knowledge rise instead of insight. The veil behind her remains... but you may be looking away from what it hides. When truth whispers, will you hear it?",
      "interpretation_up_past": "In your past, there was a time when you simply knew... even if you couldn't explain how. The High Priestess upright suggests that your silence then wasn't weakness... it was wisdom. You watched, you sensed, you waited... and that choice shaped everything.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, not everything is meant to be known... not yet. The High Priestess in the present asks you to pause, to feel, to trust your intuition more than the noise around you. The answers you're looking for aren't outside... they're waiting quietly within.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "Soon, a situation will unfold that can't be solved with logic alone. The High Priestess hints at a hidden truth approaching... something subtle but powerful. Watch the signs, feel the shifts, and trust your inner compass when others are still guessing.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "Looking back, there was a moment when passion clouded judgment. The High Priestess reversed marks a chapter where insight was ignored... or dressed up as certainty. You may have spoken when you should've listened... the lesson still lingers.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "At this moment, there may be noise where there should be silence. The High Priestess reversed signals a disconnect... you might be overthinking, or chasing answers in the wrong places. Slow down. What you're avoiding may be exactly what you need to face.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "Ahead lies a test of discernment. The High Priestess reversed warns that someone may withhold truth... or perhaps you'll be tempted to look only at the surface. The veil will not lift for the impatient. Be still. The deeper story will soon emerge.",
      "love_up_past": "Something about your energy draws me to a relationship from the past... one that was quiet but meaningful, mysterious yet magnetic. The High Priestess upright suggests you loved from a deep, soulful place... where feelings were sensed more than spoken. This connection may have shaped your understanding of intimacy... even now.",
      "love_up_present": "There's an undeniable pulse in your love life right now... something unspoken but deeply felt. I sense someone around you holding back their true emotions, or maybe you are. The High Priestess urges patience... not everything needs to be said aloud... some truths are discovered in the quiet between glances.",
      "love_up_future": "I feel a love approaching that won't announce itself with drama or noise... but rather enter like a dream. The High Priestess shows a connection built on intuition, shared silences, and mutual understanding. Trust your instincts... you'll feel this bond long before you recognize it.",
      "love_rev_past": "There was once a relationship that felt clouded... as if truth was withheld or feelings only partially shared. I sense the emotional residue of being misunderstood... or perhaps not fully trusting someone close. The High Priestess reversed points to passion that lacked clarity... a lesson you haven't quite let go of.",
      "love_rev_present": "Something isn't quite right romantically... I feel confusion or misalignment. Either you or your partner may be overthinking or projecting feelings that don't match reality. The High Priestess reversed advises you to stop searching for answers in others... and start trusting what your gut has been whispering.",
      "love_rev_future": "A romantic encounter is coming... but it may not be what it seems. I sense charm, allure, even desire... but the truth may be obscured. The High Priestess reversed warns against ignoring red flags or inner doubts. Love deserves transparency... and so do you.",
      "career_up_past": "I sense you once held back in your career... not from weakness, but from watching, learning, absorbing. The High Priestess upright suggests a time when you gathered knowledge behind the scenes, playing a quiet but pivotal role. You may not have been in the spotlight... but your influence was undeniable.",
      "career_up_present": "There's something subtle stirring in your career path right now... a shift behind the curtain. You may be preparing for a change, or quietly mastering a new skill. The High Priestess invites you to trust the timing... a breakthrough is coming, but it begins in silence and self-trust.",
      "career_up_future": "Your future work holds mystery... not confusion, but potential just beyond sight. I sense an opportunity involving intuition, teaching, or guiding others through unknowns. The High Priestess says: prepare yourself inwardly... for the role you're stepping into may be more spiritual or meaningful than you expect.",
      "career_rev_past": "Your career past carries the mark of a decision made in haste... or perhaps a job taken without inner alignment. The High Priestess reversed shows a time when image or surface choices masked a deeper calling. It's okay... but it's time to revisit what your soul actually wants from your work.",
      "career_rev_present": "Right now, your professional life feels off-balance. I sense an overreliance on logic or appearances, while your intuition is being silenced. The High Priestess reversed warns of ignoring red flags at work... whether in a partnership, contract, or project. Listen within... the truth is waiting.",
      "career_rev_future": "A tempting offer may soon arise... but all that glitters isn't gold. The High Priestess reversed speaks of workplace illusion... someone may be keeping secrets, or your instincts may scream something your mind wants to ignore. Don't say yes too quickly... wait until the truth surfaces.",
      "finances_up_past": "I sense you once managed your finances with quiet wisdom. There was a time you knew when to wait, when to save, and when to trust that things would align. The High Priestess upright honors that discernment... a time when inner stillness brought outer stability.",
      "finances_up_present": "Your financial world is changing, even if the shifts aren't yet visible. The High Priestess urges you to look beneath the numbers... track your patterns, habits, and emotional reactions to money. There's a deeper story playing out... and once you see it, you'll know exactly how to move.",
      "finances_up_future": "Money flows in cycles... and yours is entering a quiet, steady rise. The High Priestess offers prosperity that's subtle, not flashy... long-term gain through spiritual or intellectual alignment. Listen for subtle nudges... abundance will follow your inner clarity.",
      "finances_rev_past": "In the past, you may have been financially misled... or misled yourself. I sense a time when you trusted someone else's judgment over your own, or avoided facing the truth of your spending. The High Priestess reversed holds no shame... only the reminder that truth builds wealth.",
      "finances_rev_present": "Something feels hidden in your current financial situation. I sense missed details... maybe in a contract, a shared account, or even your own mindset. The High Priestess reversed urges you to stop avoiding the discomfort... look at your finances with clear eyes and deeper trust in your inner wisdom.",
      "finances_rev_future": "An unclear financial opportunity may present itself... and it will be tempting. But I urge caution. The High Priestess reversed warns that your future prosperity hinges on discernment... don't say yes to what doesn't fully feel right, even if it looks perfect on paper.",
      "feelings_up_past": "There was a time when you were deeply in tune with yourself... though you may not have realized it then. The High Priestess upright reflects a past where you felt things others missed... when your emotional awareness guided your path, even in silence.",
      "feelings_up_present": "Your emotions right now are vast and rich... but not all are easily named. I sense a quiet inner tide rising... perhaps healing, perhaps longing. The High Priestess says you don't need to explain everything... sometimes feeling deeply is the wisdom itself.",
      "feelings_up_future": "Your emotional path ahead holds a powerful awakening. You'll soon feel something that clarifies everything... not from logic, but from the way your heart responds. The High Priestess promises that truth is coming... and it will speak softly, but profoundly.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "Your emotional history carries a silence... a time when you didn't feel safe enough to express what was truly inside. The High Priestess reversed reflects suppression, or performing what you thought others wanted. That mask was heavy... it's okay to release it now.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "Right now, you may be emotionally disconnected... either overwhelmed or distant from your true self. The High Priestess reversed whispers that it's time to stop pretending. Dive inward... the answers you seek about your feelings won't come from outside validation.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "I sense emotional confusion on the horizon... not failure, but uncertainty. The High Priestess reversed warns that ignoring your feelings may create more chaos than confronting them. Let yourself feel the messy parts... healing is only possible when the truth is honored.",
      "actions_up_past": "You once made a quiet but profound choice. Not everyone noticed it... but it shaped your path. The High Priestess upright honors that sacred moment... when you trusted your inner voice instead of the crowd, and it led you to wisdom.",
      "actions_up_present": "The time for outward action may not be now... but inward movement is essential. I feel a moment where stillness is the action... where reflection will serve you more than reaction. The High Priestess says... trust the pause. It's preparing you for something important.",
      "actions_up_future": "Soon, you'll face a decision that requires subtlety, not speed. I sense an opportunity where action will look more like restraint... where not reacting is the boldest move. The High Priestess promises that you'll know when the moment is right. Trust the quiet instinct.",
      "actions_rev_past": "There was an action in your past taken from impulse rather than clarity. I feel its ripple even now... a move made without listening fully to yourself. The High Priestess reversed doesn't judge... but she reminds you to learn from what was rushed.",
      "actions_rev_present": "You might be forcing something that isn't ready to unfold. The energy around your choices feels scattered or over-controlled. The High Priestess reversed says: release the grip. Stop doing just for the sake of it. Center yourself... then choose again.",
      "actions_rev_future": "I sense a challenge coming that will test your ability to wait, to watch, to trust. The High Priestess reversed warns that reacting too soon... or for the wrong reasons... could unravel something precious. Pause. Let the truth make itself known before you move."

      "desc": "A stately figure, seated, having rich vestments and royal aspect, as of a daughter of heaven and earth. Her diadem is of twelve stars, gathered in a cluster. The symbol of Venus is on the shield which rests near her. A field of corn is ripening in front of her, and beyond there is a fall of water. The sceptre which she bears is surmounted by the globe of this world. She is the inferior Garden of Eden, the Earthly Paradise, all that is symbolized by the visible house of man. She is not Regina coeli, but she is still refugium peccatorum, the fruitful mother of thousands. There are also certain aspects in which she has been correctly described as desire and the wings thereof, as the woman clothed with the sun, as Gloria Mundi and the veil of the Sanctum Sanctorum; but she is not, I may add, the soul that has attained wings, unless all the symbolism is counted up another and unusual way. She is above all things universal fecundity and the outer sense of the Word. This is obvious, because there is no direct message which has been given to man like that which is borne by woman; but she does not herself carry its interpretation.\nIn another order of ideas, the card of the Empress signifies the door or gate by which an entrance is obtained into this life, as into the Garden of Venus; and then the way which leads out therefrom, into that which is beyond, is the secret known to the High Priestess: it is communicated by her to the elect. Most old attributions of this card are completely wrong on the symbolism--as, for example, its identification with the Word, Divine Nature, the Triad, and so forth.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Empress graces your spread upright... and that is a blessing not to be taken lightly. She brings signs of fruitfulness, initiative, and action... a fertile moment is opening for you. Her crown of twelve stars gleams with divine favor, while the golden field before her echoes abundance taking root in the real world.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Empress appears reversed... her garden wilts, and the truth beneath the surface begs to be seen. This card warns of vacillation, overexposure, and clarity that stings rather than soothes. The water behind her still flows, but it may carry what was once hidden into the open.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "There was a time when creativity and nurturing defined your steps. Whether you built a home, a dream, or a connection... it left echoes of beauty behind you. You gave life to something that still blossoms in memory.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, the world around you may be more responsive than you realize. What you pour your energy into will grow... so choose carefully. The Empress whispers of harmony, beauty, and creation waiting to respond to your touch.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "A cycle of growth is on the horizon. If you nourish your ideas or relationships now, they will reward you richly. Prepare to receive... for the harvest is coming, and you've planted something worth waiting for.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "There may have been a moment when you ignored your intuition or neglected your inner world. Things looked full on the outside... but something essential was missing. That hollowness wasn't failure, just a lesson in self-worth.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "Your surroundings may seem busy or abundant... but underneath, there's emotional fatigue or indecision. The Empress reversed urges you to reconnect with your source... don't keep giving without refilling your own cup.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "Soon, you may be called to step back and reevaluate what truly brings you joy. Not every seed leads to fruit. If you're feeling scattered or uncertain, wait. Clarity will return once you clear the noise around you.",
      "love_up_past": "I'm sensing the echo of a love that felt safe, nurturing, and deeply rooted. The Empress upright in your past shows you were once in a relationship that blossomed because you gave it your all... warmth, devotion, and patience were your offerings and they left their mark.",
      "love_up_present": "There's a strong sense that love is growing around you... perhaps quietly, like wildflowers in spring. The Empress speaks of romantic energy that feels soft yet powerful... if you're in a relationship, this could be a time of bonding. If not, someone nurturing may already be noticing you.",
      "love_up_future": "Love is forming into something more tangible... I can feel it. If you continue to lead with your heart and keep your emotional soil healthy, a deeply fulfilling connection could begin to flourish... one built on care, not performance.",
      "love_rev_past": "There was once love that seemed full on the surface but lacked depth below... I feel the hollow ache of emotional neglect or being taken for granted. The Empress reversed here hints that you may have given too much without receiving enough... and it left a wound.",
      "love_rev_present": "Right now, love may feel off-balance. There's emotional disconnection or unmet needs. You may be overextending yourself or looking for validation where there is no nourishment. The Empress reversed reminds you... real love feeds you too.",
      "love_rev_future": "I feel a love-related decision approaching... one that may tempt you to settle for beauty without substance. The Empress reversed warns against chasing comfort when it costs you emotional truth. Let things bloom naturally or not at all.",
      "career_up_past": "You once led with creativity and initiative... I see a period when your work felt like a garden you tended well. The Empress upright says you left a trail of productivity and trust... your past actions continue to support your reputation.",
      "career_up_present": "I sense opportunity all around you in your professional life. You're in a fertile season... new projects, collaborations, or even leadership roles could be in bloom. Let your ideas speak... The Empress gives you permission to lead with vision.",

      "desc": "He has a form of the Crux ansata for his sceptre and a globe in his left hand. He is a crowned monarch--commanding, stately, seated on a throne, the arms of which axe fronted by rams' heads. He is executive and realization, the power of this world, here clothed with the highest of its natural attributes. He is occasionally represented as seated on a cubic stone, which, however, confuses some of the issues. He is the virile power, to which the Empress responds, and in this sense is he who seeks to remove the Veil of Isis; yet she remains virgo intacta.\nIt should be understood that this card and that of the Empress do not precisely represent the condition of married life, though this state is implied. On the surface, as I have indicated, they stand for mundane royalty, uplifted on the seats of the mighty; but above this there is the suggestion of another presence. They signify also--and the male figure especially--the higher kingship, occupying the intellectual throne. Hereof is the lordship of thought rather than of the animal world. Both personalities, after their own manner, are \"full of strange experience,\" but theirs is not consciously the wisdom which draws from a higher world. The Emperor has been described as (a) will in its embodied form, but this is only one of its applications, and (b) as an expression of virtualities contained in the Absolute Being--but this is fantasy.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Emperor stands before you... a symbol of solid ground and structured power. This upright draw marks a fortunate moment... a time when authority, reason, and realization align. From his ram-adorned throne and scepter of life, he radiates stability and a command over the tangible world... you're being asked to rise into your own sovereignty.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "You've drawn The Emperor in reverse... and with that comes a ripple of imbalance. This isn't mere misfortune, it's a sign of internal confusion or outside obstruction. The symbols of kingship... globe, throne, and scepter... now feel less like anchors and more like burdens. Someone's control may be softening into chaos... is it yours, or theirs?",
      "interpretation_up_past": "You've built your past on firm foundations. Whether it was discipline, structure, or wise counsel, there was a time you embraced responsibility and earned respect... the echoes of that still shape who you are today.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Now is the time to take command. The world is looking for leadership... and The Emperor says it's your turn to offer guidance, protect what you've built, and make decisions not from fear... but from steady conviction.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "A situation is coming that will test your ability to lead or uphold order. You'll be called to embody strength, not through force, but by setting clear boundaries and standing firm... the throne ahead is yours if you choose to sit on it.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "There may have been a time when control was either lacking... or overbearing. Perhaps someone else dictated your path, or you tried to force results before they were ready. That history still lingers... waiting to be understood.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "Things feel uncertain right now... your footing, your choices, maybe even your identity. The reversed Emperor warns of immaturity or blurred leadership... whether it's you second-guessing yourself or others misleading the situation.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "Ahead lies a challenge tied to structure and power. If you're not grounded, you may either yield your voice too easily... or try to dominate what's not yours to control. The Emperor reversed asks you to realign... or risk building on sand.",

The Emperor upright here speaks to a stable bond, possibly one built on traditional roles or firm boundaries... even if it lacked softness, it had structure.",
      "love_up_present": "Love feels grounded now... or is asking to be. The Emperor suggests that emotional chaos isn't welcome anymore. You're either seeking someone dependable or learning to be that anchor yourself... strength is becoming your love language.",
      "love_up_future": "I feel a connection forming that will be based not on fleeting chemistry but on loyalty and protection. The Emperor upright says someone with strong principles is approaching... or you are becoming that person yourself. This is love with long-term vision.",
      "love_rev_past": "There's a shadow of emotional rigidity from a past relationship... a love that felt more like control. The reversed Emperor says someone may have tried to dominate or suppress vulnerability... and it left scars you still carry.",
      "love_rev_present": "Something in your current relationship lacks balance. I sense power struggles... or the absence of healthy leadership. The Emperor reversed warns that love may feel more like a game of authority than a true union of hearts.",
      "love_rev_future": "The road ahead in romance may test your sense of independence. I feel a partner who may come across as overbearing... or maybe it's you who's trying to lead with rules instead of empathy. The Emperor reversed urges emotional wisdom over control.",

      "career_rev_past": "I'm drawn to a time when your career was disrupted by poor management... or your own resistance to structure. The reversed Emperor reflects frustration over lost direction... or the struggle to respect authority that wasn't earned.",
      "career_rev_present": "Career energy feels blocked right now. Either someone above you is misusing power... or you're hesitating to take control where needed. The Emperor reversed says indecision and lack of structure are stalling progress.",
      "career_rev_future": "I see a crossroads coming... one where leadership will be tested. If you lack clarity, others may override you. The Emperor reversed warns not to let fear of confrontation silence your ideas... lead, or be led astray.",
      "finances_up_past": "In the past, you likely handled your finances with care and authority. I sense structure... budgeting, planning, maybe even providing for others. The Emperor upright shows you valued stability over impulse.",
      "finances_up_present": "There's strong financial energy around you now. I feel a time to solidify your resources... lock things in. The Emperor advises that logic, not emotion, should guide your spending or saving decisions.",
      "finances_up_future": "I sense a major financial goal becoming achievable soon. It will take discipline... but it's possible. The Emperor upright shows wealth built on structure... like a house with a firm foundation. Think long-term.",
      "finances_rev_past": "Your financial history holds a period of misjudgment... perhaps funds mismanaged or controlled by someone else. The reversed Emperor signals a lack of order... or money slipping through unprotected hands.",
      "finances_rev_present": "Right now, your finances may feel unstable. I sense either over-control or complete neglect. The Emperor reversed warns you to take back your authority over money before others or circumstances do it for you.",

      "feelings_rev_present": "Right now, you may feel cut off from your own emotional truth... either by overthinking or trying to stay in control. The Emperor reversed warns of emotional disconnection masked as strength. Let yourself feel.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "Emotional tests are ahead... and you might try to meet them with logic alone. The Emperor reversed cautions against walling off your heart. What's coming needs empathy, not just resolve.",
      "actions_up_past": "I sense a moment in your history where you took a firm stand. That action defined a chapter... and it earned respect. The Emperor upright speaks to the impact of a strong, deliberate choice made with clear intent.",

      "desc": "He wears the triple crown and is seated between two pillars, but they are not those of the Temple which is guarded by the High Priestess. In his left hand he holds a sceptre terminating in the triple cross, and with his right hand he gives the well-known ecclesiastical sign which is called that of esotericism, distinguishing between the manifest and concealed part of doctrine. It is noticeable in this connexion that the High Priestess makes no sign. At his feet are the crossed keys, and two priestly ministers in albs kneel before him. He has been usually called the Pope, which is a particular application of the more general office that he symbolizes. He is the ruling power of external religion, as the High Priestess is the prevailing genius of the esoteric, withdrawn power. The proper meanings of this card have suffered woeful admixture from nearly all hands. Grand Orient says truly that the Hierophant is the power of the keys, exoteric orthodox doctrine, and the outer side of the life which leads to the doctrine; but he is certainly not the prince of occult doctrine, as another commentator has suggested.\nHe is rather the summa totius theologi√¶, when it has passed into the utmost rigidity of expression; but he symbolizes also all things that are righteous and sacred on the manifest side. As such, he is the channel of grace belonging to the world of institution as distinct from that of Nature, and he is the leader of salvation for the human race at large. He is the order and the head of the recognized hierarchy, which is the reflection of another and greater hierarchic order; but it may so happen that the pontiff forgets the significance of this his symbolic state and acts as if he contained within his proper measures all that his sign signifies or his symbol seeks to shew forth. He is not, as it has been thought, philosophy-except on the theological side; he is not inspiration; and he is not religion, although he is a mode of its expression.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "This is The Hierophant... a card of sacred order and spiritual tradition. Upright, it's a fortunate draw and speaks of alliance, mercy, and inspiration. With crossed keys at his feet and ritual sign in hand, he represents the external power of belief systems and the grace found within structured paths.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "This is The Hierophant... but drawn reversed, his wisdom turns rigid, and the blessing becomes muddled. This isn't a lucky pull. It warns of overkindness that invites imbalance, and social structures that may no longer support you. The triple crown he wears feels heavier now, as tradition bends into weakness.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "There was a time when you leaned on structure... maybe family, school, or a belief system guided you forward. The Hierophant upright says those roots gave you something sacred... a compass or connection that still echoes.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, tradition plays a role in your life, whether you're honoring it... or challenging it. The Hierophant reminds you that wisdom can come from those who walked before you. Seek counsel, or become the guide yourself.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "Ahead lies a moment where structure and faith will support you. It could be mentorship, marriage, or a group that holds shared values. The Hierophant's path isn't flashy... but it's steady, sacred, and meant to last.",

      "love_up_past": "I'm sensing a love story shaped by tradition... like the kind where roles were clearly defined, and expectations were honored. The Hierophant upright suggests a relationship that followed the rules... perhaps family or faith played a role in how love unfolded.",
      "love_up_present": "Love feels tied to deeper values right now... as if you're craving more than just connection, but a shared belief system. The Hierophant's presence suggests a bond that may be growing stronger through mutual respect or even sacred vows.",
      "love_up_future": "The path ahead in love carries the scent of commitment... I feel a sacred energy around partnership, perhaps even marriage. The Hierophant is pointing toward something blessed... but only if both hearts are aligned in purpose and principle.",
      "love_rev_past": "A shadow lingers from a time when love was tangled in appearances or external pressures... I'm picking up on a relationship that looked right on paper but lacked true connection. The reversed Hierophant shows how surface approval can't replace inner truth.",
      "love_rev_present": "I sense conflict between what you feel and what others expect of your love life... this reversed energy warns of conforming for the sake of peace. The Hierophant is upside-down now... urging you to choose intimacy over image.",
      "love_rev_future": "There's a fork in your romantic path ahead... and I feel tradition may try to dictate your heart. The Hierophant reversed says love may be tested by rules that no longer serve. If it feels forced, it's not your truth.",

      "career_up_present": "The energy in your professional world feels steady, even sacred. I sense you're either stepping into leadership... or learning from someone who embodies tradition and ethics. The Hierophant encourages learning through structure now.",
      "career_up_future": "In the near future, a career opportunity will come from a place of tradition or hierarchy... perhaps a promotion, certification, or institutional role. The Hierophant blesses this path... if you're ready to honor the rules it comes with.",
      "career_rev_past": "There's a job or path you once walked that felt out of alignment with your values... I'm seeing a situation where structure turned into stagnation. The Hierophant reversed marks a time when the system became a cage.",
      "career_rev_present": "Work feels... misaligned. Maybe you're going through the motions or following outdated protocols. The reversed Hierophant urges you to question if you're truly fulfilled... or just checking boxes.",
      "career_rev_future": "Soon you may be faced with a choice between security and authenticity. The Hierophant reversed suggests a career move that seems wise... but may compromise your deeper calling. Be brave enough to say no.",
      "finances_up_past": "I'm getting a memory of stability... your past financial decisions were likely rooted in wisdom passed down, or guided by mentors. The Hierophant upright says tradition helped you build slowly but securely.",
      "finances_up_present": "The money energy around you now feels... orderly. I sense structure, budgets, maybe even conservative investments. The Hierophant supports this path... reminding you that slow and steady still wins the race.",
      "finances_up_future": "You're on track to improve your financial standing... especially through institutional support like banks, advisors, or long-term planning. The Hierophant sees structure ahead... and it will work in your favor.",

      "finances_rev_present": "Something feels off in your current money situation... like you're being too generous or relying on outdated methods. The Hierophant reversed warns you to stop assuming authority equals accuracy. Do your own math.",
      "finances_rev_future": "A financial decision lies ahead... and I sense pressure to conform. The reversed Hierophant says not all advice is sacred. You'll need to trust your own judgment, especially when the numbers don't add up.",
      "feelings_up_past": "There was a time you sought emotional comfort in familiar rituals... I can feel that. The Hierophant upright says your feelings were shaped by what was expected... but they still had truth and safety within them.",
      "feelings_up_present": "Right now, your emotional state is seeking balance through structure... like you're craving guidance or stability in your inner world. The Hierophant offers emotional clarity through reflection and shared wisdom.",
      "feelings_up_future": "In the coming days, you may find emotional peace by aligning with a belief or spiritual path... I sense healing through sacred repetition. The Hierophant brings serenity when the heart and mind walk the same path.",

      "actions_up_future": "An opportunity will soon require you to lead by example... not through rebellion, but through honor. The Hierophant shows a moment ahead when calm, sacred action will ripple much farther than bold disruption.",
      "actions_rev_past": "You once acted impulsively or defied a structure... and the consequences still linger. The reversed Hierophant remembers that decision as a lesson... not a failure, but a reminder that rebellion must have purpose.",
      "actions_rev_present": "There's pressure to act a certain way right now... but it feels forced. The Hierophant reversed urges you to pause. If your next move doesn't feel aligned with your inner truth, it will only breed confusion.",
      "actions_rev_future": "Soon, you may be tempted to conform just to get something done... but the cost could be clarity. The Hierophant reversed whispers that bold action isn't always loud... sometimes it's just saying no to the wrong thing."

In the foreground are two human figures, male and female, unveiled before each other, as if Adam and Eve when they first occupied the paradise of the earthly body. Behind the man is the Tree of Life, bearing twelve fruits, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is behind the woman; the serpent is twining round it. The figures suggest youth, virginity, innocence and love before it is contaminated by gross material desire. This is in all simplicity the card of human love, here exhibited as part of the way, the truth and the life. It replaces, by recourse to first principles, the old card of marriage, which I have described previously, and the later follies which depicted man between vice and virtue. In a very high sense, the card is a mystery of the Covenant and Sabbath.\nThe suggestion in respect of the woman is that she signifies that attraction towards the sensitive life which carries within it the idea of the Fall of Man, but she is rather the working of a Secret Law of Providence than a willing and conscious temptress. It is through her imputed lapse that man shall arise ultimately, and only by her can he complete himself. The card is therefore in its way another intimation concerning the great mystery of womanhood. The old meanings fall to pieces of necessity with the old pictures, but even as interpretations of the latter, some of them were of the order of commonplace and others were false in symbolism.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Lovers have appeared upright... and you should consider yourself fortunate. This card is a rare moment of harmony, attraction, and truth overcoming trials. It speaks of real beauty... not just in form, but in choice. The sun above them blesses the connection, and the angel watches silently, suggesting divine timing. This is a sacred union or a powerful decision... and it's unfolding now.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "You've pulled The Lovers in reverse... and it's a troubling sign. The energy here hints at failure, misaligned intentions, and plans that may collapse under their own weight. The angel still watches, but from a distance now... and the paradise behind the figures feels more like a memory than a promise. Something isn't adding up in the realm of union or direction.",

This wasn't just romance... it was a bond that brought growth and trial, and through it, you discovered more about who you are and what you're truly drawn to.",
      "love_up_present": "I feel strong energy circling your current love situation... the Lovers card suggests a meaningful decision or deep attraction is unfolding. If you've met someone recently or reconnected with a partner, it may be more than chance... this moment was meant to test or affirm your heart.",
      "love_up_future": "The path ahead feels charged with love... a fated connection, or a defining romantic choice. Whether you're about to meet someone new or deepen an existing bond, what comes next may be life-changing. The Lovers promises alignment if your actions match your heart.",
      "love_rev_past": "There's a lingering ache in your love history... a choice that didn't serve you, or a relationship that ended in disconnection. The Lovers reversed speaks of a time when love brought more confusion than clarity... and a lesson was learned the hard way.",
      "love_rev_present": "In the realm of relationships, things may not be as they seem. The Lovers reversed points to imbalance, hesitation, or temptation outside of truth. Trust your gut... if something feels off, it likely is.",
      "love_rev_future": "I sense turbulence ahead in your romantic path. The Lovers reversed warns of choices made out of fear or fantasy. If someone new enters your life or if your heart feels pulled elsewhere, pause. Ask yourself... is this love, or is this escape?",

He has led captivity captive; he is conquest on all planes--in the mind, in science, in progress, in certain trials of initiation. He has thus replied to the sphinx, and it is on this account that I have accepted the variation of √âliphas L√©vi; two sphinxes thus draw his chariot. He is above all things triumph in the mind.\nIt is to be understood for this reason (a) that the question of the sphinx is concerned with a Mystery of Nature and not of the world of Grace, to which the charioteer could offer no answer; (b) that the planes of his conquest are manifest or external and not within himself; (c) that the liberation which he effects may leave himself in the bondage of the logical understanding; (d) that the tests of initiation through which he has passed in triumph are to be understood physically or rationally; and (e) that if he came to the pillars of that Temple between which the High Priestess is seated, he could not open the scroll called Tora, nor if she questioned him could he answer. He is not hereditary royalty and he is not priesthood.",

      "desc": "A woman, over whose head there broods the same symbol of life which we have seen in the card of the Magician, is closing the jaws of a lion. The only point in which this design differs from the conventional presentations is that her beneficent fortitude has already subdued the lion, which is being led by a chain of flowers. For reasons which satisfy myself, this card has been interchanged with that of justice, which is usually numbered eight. As the variation carries nothing with it which will signify to the reader, there is no cause for explanation. Fortitude, in one of its most exalted aspects, is connected with the Divine Mystery of Union; the virtue, of course, operates in all planes, and hence draws on all in its symbolism. It connects also with innocentia inviolata, and with the strength which resides in contemplation.\nThese higher meanings are, however, matters of inference, and I do not suggest that they are transparent on the surface of the card. They are intimated in a concealed manner by the chain of flowers, which signifies, among many other things, the sweet yoke and the light burden of Divine Law, when it has been taken into the heart of hearts. The card has nothing to do with self-confidence in the ordinary sense, though this has been suggested--but it concerns the confidence of those whose strength is God, who have found their refuge in Him. There is one aspect in which the lion signifies the passions, and she who is called Strength is the higher nature in its liberation. It has walked upon the asp and the basilisk and has trodden down the lion and the dragon.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "This is Strength... and you've drawn it upright, how lucky you are to receive such a potent sign of strength and honor. This card reflects power, action, and magnanimity... symbolized by the woman taming the lion not through force, but through the quiet grace of a floral chain and an unwavering calm that speaks to divine union.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "This is Strength... but it has arrived reversed, and that's no small omen. The energies shift now toward weakness, discord, and an abuse of power... reflected in the lion's resistance, the unraveling of the gentle chain of flowers, and the woman's struggle to maintain control not through grace, but desperation.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "In the past, you've demonstrated great inner resilience, drawing from a place of quiet power others may not have noticed. The trials you endured were tamed not by dominance, but through compassion and consistent effort.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, you're being asked to lean into your strength... not the loud kind, but the steady one that reassures and endures. There's a situation that calls for leadership through empathy rather than assertion.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "Looking ahead, success is near... but it will require both bravery and patience. A calm persistence will earn you recognition and possibly even honors, especially when you choose mercy over might.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "You may have once misused your influence or witnessed someone close doing so, causing rifts and emotional strain. The lion once trusted, now growls... reminding you of wounds unhealed and strength misdirected.",

      "love_up_future": "There's a quiet but powerful shift ahead in your romantic path... Soon, you'll be called to lead with heart over ego. A relationship may test your softness and your steel... if you remain grounded, love will bloom under pressure.",
      "love_rev_past": "Something about your romantic past still claws at your spirit... There may have been moments where power was misused, or a partner tried to dominate rather than understand. The scars you carry remind you of what kind of strength love truly requires.",
      "love_rev_present": "Love energy feels unbalanced right now... Perhaps you're giving too much, or perhaps resentment simmers beneath the surface. There's a need to reclaim your emotional center... compassion isn't weakness, but don't let yourself be led by fear or force.",

      "career_up_future": "Something is coming... a leadership role, a tough decision, or a project that demands discipline... Your inner strength will rise to meet it. Lead with integrity and quiet confidence and you'll command not just respect, but lasting results.",
      "career_rev_past": "There were past missteps in your career that came from misused influence or unchecked ambition... Perhaps you overreached, or trusted someone who didn't act with honor. These lessons in restraint were harsh, but necessary.",
      "career_rev_present": "In your current work, something feels off... Authority may be abused, or maybe you're feeling drained and unheard. Strength now means setting clear boundaries and remembering your own worth in environments that try to diminish it.",

      "feelings_rev_past": "Your past emotions may have felt overwhelming or mismanaged... Maybe you held too much in, or let raw feelings lead you into regret. Either way, emotional strength was tested, and not all wounds healed cleanly.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "Something in your emotional energy feels off balance... Perhaps you're bottling things up or exploding without warning. The reversed Strength suggests it's time to face what's inside without fear of falling apart.",

I have said that this is a card of attainment, and to extend this conception the figure is seen holding up his beacon on an eminence. Therefore the Hermit is not, as Court de Gebelin explained, a wise man in search of truth and justice; nor is he, as a later explanation proposes, an especial example of experience. His beacon intimates that \"where I am, you also may be.\"\nIt is further a card which is understood quite incorrectly when it is connected with the idea of occult isolation, as the protection of personal magnetism against admixture. This is one of the frivolous renderings which we owe to √âliphas L√©vi. It has been adopted by the French Order of Martinism and some of us have heard a great deal of the Silent and Unknown Philosophy enveloped by his mantle from the knowledge of the profane. In true Martinism, the significance of the term Philosophe inconnu was of another order. It did not refer to the intended concealment of the Instituted Mysteries, much less of their substitutes, but--like the card itself--to the truth that the Divine Mysteries secure their own protection from those who are unprepared.",

It's a sign that you're being guided by a higher light... perhaps your own. Through quiet detachment, secrets are revealed and the path forward becomes illuminated. The Hermit reflects not isolation, but elevation... rising above the noise to carry wisdom earned through solitude.",

      "desc": "In this symbol I have again followed the reconstruction of √âliphas L√©vi, who has furnished several variants. It is legitimate--as I have intimated--to use Egyptian symbolism when this serves our purpose, provided that no theory of origin is implied therein. I have, however, presented Typhon in his serpent form. The symbolism is, of course, not exclusively Egyptian, as the four Living Creatures of Ezekiel occupy the angles of the card, and the wheel itself follows other indications of L√©vi in respect of Ezekiel's vision, as illustrative of the particular Tarot Key. With the French occultist, and in the design itself, the symbolic picture stands for the perpetual motion of a fluidic universe and for the flux of human life. The Sphinx is the equilibrium therein. The transliteration of Taro as Rota is inscribed on the wheel, counterchanged with the letters of the Divine Name--to shew that Providence is imphed through all. But this is the Divine intention within, and the similar intention without is exemplified by the four Living Creatures. Sometimes the sphinx is represented couchant on a pedestal above, which defrauds the symbolism by stultifying the essential idea of stability amidst movement.\nBehind the general notion expressed in the symbol there lies the denial of chance and the fatality which is implied therein. It may be added that, from the days of L√©vi onward, the occult explanations of this card are--even for occultism itself--of a singularly fatuous kind. It has been said to mean principle, fecundity, virile honour, ruling authority, etc. The findings of common fortune-telling are better than this on their own plane.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Wheel of Fortune spins in your favor... What luck you've drawn it upright. This card pulses with destiny, success, and the sudden rise of good fortune. It signals elevation and felicity, shaped by unseen forces that twist fate in your favor. The Sphinx above and the four creatures below suggest that while change is constant, your spirit stands at the very center of the storm, balanced, evolving.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "You've drawn the Wheel of Fortune, but it's reversed, and that shifts everything... Not so lucky this time. Though abundance and increase are still within reach, this energy may feel overwhelming or misplaced. The wheel may be spinning, but you're not the one steering. Typhon's serpent coils stir chaos, and what once felt like fate now feels like a blur of too much, too fast.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "In the past, fate turned in your favor. A chapter of success, luck, or unexpected blessings helped you rise above previous trials. The winds of life lifted you higher, and whether or not you saw it at the time, you were in the flow.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, destiny is in motion. Forces outside your control are aligning... not to block you, but to lift you. Even if it seems chaotic, there's a bigger rhythm at work. Trust the process. The Sphinx doesn't flinch.",

      "interpretation_rev_past": "In the past, things may have spun too quickly. Success came, but not in balance... or perhaps abundance flowed in ways that weren't entirely helpful. The reversed Wheel suggests a time when fate overwhelmed rather than supported you.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "The present feels like too much, or like you're stuck in a loop. Abundance may be pouring in... but are you drowning in it instead of riding the wave? The Wheel reversed says slow down, recenter, and remember not all growth is gain.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "If you're not careful, the future could bring a whirlwind that feels more like a storm than a gift. An excess of opportunity, energy, or attention may spin out of control. The reversed Wheel warns... prepare now before you're caught off guard.",
      "love_up_past": "Your past love life shows moments of serendipity... There may have been an encounter that felt fated, a relationship that seemed to arrive at just the right time. Even heartbreak had its purpose, it moved you to where your heart needed to go.",
      "love_up_present": "Love feels destined right now... Someone may be entering, or reentering, your life just when you need it. The Wheel reminds you that timing is everything, and this moment could change everything for your heart.",
      "love_up_future": "I sense love approaching like a twist in your story... A powerful connection may rise soon, not because you forced it, but because the universe decided you were ready. Trust that fate has a plan for your heart.",
      "love_rev_past": "In the past, love may have felt like a cycle you couldn't break... Missed chances, poor timing, or patterns you repeated without meaning to. The reversed Wheel reveals lessons left unlearned... and a heart that tried to rush what needed time.",
      "love_rev_present": "Your romantic life feels out of sync right now... Are you chasing something that's running from you, or clinging to something that should've ended? The reversed Wheel suggests fate is pausing for a reason... listen before you push again.",
      "love_rev_future": "There's a warning here... A romantic turn ahead could feel chaotic if you try to force it. Destiny doesn't move on demand. The reversed Wheel says... wait for the right moment, or you'll spin into confusion instead of connection.",
      "career_up_past": "Your career saw a fortunate upswing before... Whether it was a promotion, a new path, or a lucky break, fate gave you a boost. Even your setbacks were redirections toward something better.",

      "career_rev_past": "The past brought career lessons wrapped in chaos... A missed opportunity, a wrong turn, or a path that wasn't truly yours. The reversed Wheel reflects cycles of dissatisfaction or instability that needed to break.",
      "career_rev_present": "Professionally, things may feel like they're spiraling... Are you moving too fast, or stuck in a role that no longer fits? The reversed Wheel says... step back and ask if this path still feels like destiny or just routine.",
      "career_rev_future": "A career shakeup could be coming... not necessarily bad, but disorienting if you're unprepared. The reversed Wheel warns... if you ignore the signs, change will come anyway, and it might come harder.",
      "finances_up_past": "You've had moments when luck blessed your wallet... Whether from a windfall or wise decision, fortune favored your finances in the past. That abundance may still echo in your present security.",

      "feelings_rev_present": "Right now your feelings feel disjointed... like your heart isn't caught up with your reality. You may be resisting a necessary change inside. The Wheel reversed says... sit with the discomfort, it's teaching you something important.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "The emotional road ahead could be bumpy... If you don't anchor yourself, you may get swept up in a cycle of highs and lows that leave you drained. The reversed Wheel whispers... ground your heart before the spin begins.",
      "actions_up_past": "Your past shows action that was timely and bold... You took initiative when the moment struck, and fate met you halfway. That courage shaped your direction, even if you didn't know it at the time.",
      "actions_up_present": "The universe is asking you to move right now... With the Wheel upright, your next steps can carry major momentum. Say yes to aligned opportunities, you're in motion whether you choose to be or not.",
      "actions_up_future": "You're about to face a moment where action matters... The wheel will turn, and hesitation could cost you. Be bold when it counts, this is your invitation to rise.",
      "actions_rev_past": "Looking back, you may see moments where impulsive action led to unexpected fallout... Or where you did nothing and fate moved without you. The reversed Wheel marks missed chances or missteps, but they don't define you.",
      "actions_rev_present": "Your current behavior may feel reactive... You're either resisting change or chasing it blindly. The Wheel reversed warns... slow down and choose your steps intentionally before chaos chooses them for you.",
      "actions_rev_future": "If you don't anchor yourself soon, your next moves may lead to cycles you've been trying to break... You can't outrun the wheel, but you can work with it. Don't repeat mistakes, rise above them."

The latter belongs to a mysterious order of Providence, in virtue of which it is possible for certain men to conceive the idea of dedication to the highest things. The operation of this is like the breathing of the Spirit where it wills, and we have no canon of criticism or ground of explanation concerning it. It is analogous to the possession of the fairy gifts and the high gifts and the gracious gifts of the poet: we have them or have not, and their presence is as much a mystery as their absence. The law of Justice is not however involved by either alternative. In conclusion, the pillars of Justice open into one world and the pillars of the High Priestess into another.",

This card speaks of equity, rightness, and triumph through integrity. Her presence reminds you that accountability isn't punishment... it's alignment.

From her seat between the pillars, she sees everything that must come into balance.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "You've drawn the card of Justice but in reverse, and that's no small warning. There's misalignment here... and you need to know it. This reversal often signals bias, harsh judgment, or legal trouble. It calls out inner contradictions or injustices dealt or received. The figure of Justice may still be seated, but her sword is heavy and her scales tip unsteadily. Something is not fair, and the imbalance must be acknowledged.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "Your past was shaped by karmic results. The actions you took or avoided were measured carefully by unseen forces. If you were honest and fair, that history still supports you. If not, you may have spent time repaying old debts.",

I will say very simply on my own part that it expresses the relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and the Universe.\nHe who can understand that the story of his higher nature is imbedded in this symbolism will receive intimations concerning a great awakening that is possible, and will know that after the sacred Mystery of Death there is a glorious Mystery of Resurrection.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Hanged Man... this card speaks of a suspension in time, a hush before transformation. How lucky you are to have drawn it upright, for it whispers of deep wisdom, sacred trials, and intuition at its peak. It suggests that you are being granted the grace of discernment, the courage to sacrifice, and the vision to see beyond the ordinary. From the vivid tree of life to the nimbus of enlightenment, all signs point to an inner awakening... a divine link between your higher self and the vastness of the universe.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Hanged Man... drawn in reverse, this card stirs up warnings from deep within. Unlucky for you, this energy twists the sacred pause into stagnation. It warns of selfishness, blind conformity, and the dangerous pull of the crowd. The divine connection hinted in the upright version becomes blurred... your inner stillness may be replaced by anxiety, impatience, or a refusal to listen to the deeper call of your spirit.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "In the past, you surrendered something important, willingly or not, and it became the silent key to your growth.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "You are now in a phase of waiting... but it's not emptiness, it's sacred stillness. Trust that your pause holds profound meaning.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "What lies ahead may require a sacrifice, but through that offering, a deeper understanding of yourself will emerge.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "You may have ignored a needed sacrifice or clung to ego when letting go was your path to clarity.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "You're stuck in a loop of hesitation or rebellion against what's being asked of you... and it's costing you insight.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "If you continue resisting the inner shift, you may find yourself trapped by shallow desires or the pull of external validation.",
      "love_up_past": "There's a strong sense that your love life has already passed through a sacred pause... A relationship may have demanded patience or sacrifice, but it opened your heart to new emotional clarity. You learned how to love without expectation, and that made all the difference.",
      "love_up_present": "Something stirs in your heart... a strange stillness in your romantic life is not emptiness but transformation in disguise. You're being asked to wait, to see things from the other's perspective. This pause is holy, not hollow.",
      "love_up_future": "A future love connection may call for emotional surrender... You might be tested to choose vulnerability over pride. But through sacrifice comes a love deeper and more spiritual than you imagined.",
      "love_rev_past": "The energy leans heavily here... A relationship may have suffered because of stubbornness or a refusal to let go. What should have been a time of healing became a tangle of ego and expectation.",
      "love_rev_present": "You're clinging to an old story in love... a refusal to see your partner's truth or your own role in the distance growing between you. This is not just stagnation... it's avoidance masked as pride.",
      "love_rev_future": "Be warned... if you resist the surrender love demands, your emotional future may become a loop of missed connections and shallow comfort. You must unlearn to receive the real thing.",
      "career_up_past": "There's a pull toward a time when you made a brave career decision... You may have chosen growth over immediate gain, and that patience is now becoming your foundation of strength.",
      "career_up_present": "You're in limbo professionally, but this is no ordinary delay... It's the universe asking you to reflect. A shift in perspective could reveal your next breakthrough. Don't rush what's ripening.",
      "career_up_future": "You may soon be asked to pause a career pursuit or sacrifice a title for deeper fulfillment. Trust this shift... what you lose in prestige, you'll gain in purpose.",
      "career_rev_past": "Something rings loud here... Perhaps you followed the crowd or ignored your calling to please others. That decision lingers still, echoing in your doubts.",
      "career_rev_present": "You're working hard but going nowhere... You may be ignoring a needed change, holding onto a job or identity that's no longer aligned with who you're becoming.",
      "career_rev_future": "If you don't choose the sacrifice yourself, the universe might do it for you... A forced career transition looms if you don't listen to the inner call to pivot.",
      "finances_up_past": "You once gave something up to get ahead... a financial decision rooted in restraint rather than greed. That moment of sacrifice is still working in your favor today.",
      "finances_up_present": "Right now your money situation is teaching you patience... You may feel stuck, but this is a spiritual pause. Greater abundance waits on the other side of a new financial perspective.",
      "finances_up_future": "You may soon be called to invest not just your money but your trust... A temporary loss or delay will plant the seeds for long-term wealth. Wisdom will guide your next financial leap.",
      "finances_rev_past": "You've possibly thrown money at problems that needed reflection... or clung to comfort instead of making a bold change. That past resistance still echoes.",
      "finances_rev_present": "You're resisting a financial shift... or ignoring what needs to be let go. The longer you delay, the harder the detachment will be. Stagnant wealth is wasted potential.",
      "finances_rev_future": "A warning vibrates here... Future financial missteps may come from refusing to shift your money mindset. Avoid repeating past errors just to feel safe.",
      "feelings_up_past": "You once dove deep into the still waters of your soul... Even if others didn't see it, you underwent an emotional transformation that set your spirit on a different path.",
      "feelings_up_present": "There's stillness in your emotional world... but this isn't numbness. You're incubating a deeper awareness of self. Trust that your quiet is holy.",
      "feelings_up_future": "Soon, you'll feel drawn inward... as if the world outside must pause so you can realign your heart. That inner peace you seek is waiting in surrender, not resistance.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "You once ignored your emotional intuition, numbing instead of feeling... That avoidance still tugs at the corners of your spirit, unresolved.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "Right now, you may be emotionally adrift... afraid to feel too much or too little. That detachment is a defense, not a solution. You're being asked to look inward.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "If you don't surrender to your inner truth soon... the emotional fallout could feel like burnout. Avoidance today becomes breakdown tomorrow.",
      "actions_up_past": "Your past actions reflect grace... You chose silence when you could've reacted. You paused, observed, sacrificed... and that wisdom still protects you.",
      "actions_up_present": "Now is not the time to act impulsively... The best action is inaction paired with awareness. Step back and allow space for the truth to emerge.",
      "actions_up_future": "The action you'll be called to take soon... is no action at all. Waiting, yielding, and surrendering will open the right path without forcing it.",
      "actions_rev_past": "You once acted for the wrong reasons... maybe to conform or to please others. That move cost you clarity, and it's time to face that truth.",
      "actions_rev_present": "You may be doing too much or nothing at all... But neither is aligned. Right now, your actions lack intention. Stop, reflect, and recalibrate.",
      "actions_rev_future": "A warning... If you continue down this path without real reflection, your future actions may entangle you further. Movement without meaning is chaos."

      "desc": "The veil or mask of life is perpetuated in change, transformation and passage from lower to higher, and this is more fitly represented in the rectified Tarot by one of the apocalyptic visions than by the crude notion of the reaping skeleton. Behind it lies the whole world of ascent in the spirit. The mysterious horseman moves slowly, bearing a black banner emblazoned with the Mystic Rose, which signifies life. Between two pillars on the verge of the horizon there shines the sun of immortality. The horseman carries no visible weapon, but king and child and maiden fall before him, while a prelate with clasped hands awaits his end.\nThere should be no need to point out that the suggestion of death which I have made in connection with the previous card is, of course, to be understood mystically, but this is not the case in the present instance. The natural transit of man to the next stage of his being either is or may be one form of his progress, but the exotic and almost unknown entrance, while still in this life, into the state of mystical death is a change in the form of consciousness and the passage into a state to which ordinary death is neither the path nor gate. The existing occult explanations of the 13th card are, on the whole, better than usual, rebirth, creation, destination, renewal, and the rest.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Death card has emerged... a sign of powerful endings and even more powerful beginnings. How fortunate you are to receive it upright, this is transformation at its highest frequency. It speaks of release, of the destruction of what no longer serves, and the eventual rebirth from the ashes. The skeletal rider carries no weapon yet brings inevitable change. Look closely... the Mystic Rose on his banner whispers that life is not ending, only changing. Even the sun beyond the pillars knows this truth.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Death card lies before you, reversed... and you need to know just how unlucky that truly is. What was meant to be a liberating transformation now becomes stagnation, inertia, and the dead weight of refusal. You are caught in the grip of lethargy, paralyzed at the threshold of change. The Mystic Rose still waves, but hope flickers in the shadows... the gate to rebirth waits, yet fear turns your face from it.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "You've already endured a powerful ending... perhaps one you didn't fully understand at the time. But that death, symbolic or real, shaped you into someone who sees through illusions.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, you're standing in the doorway of release... something must end, and deep down, you already know what it is. Let it go. What follows will breathe new life into you.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "The future will not allow you to carry the old ways forward... An ending approaches, sudden or subtle, but it will clear the path for your next evolution.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "A past event that should have changed you was resisted... You clung to what needed to die, and now its echo still traps part of your energy.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "You're in a state of emotional or spiritual paralysis... avoiding a much-needed change. It's time to admit what you're avoiding and why. Transformation waits for your permission.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "If you continue to resist change, you may enter a chapter where growth feels impossible... stuck in cycles, unable to wake from a life lived on autopilot. The longer you avoid the end, the heavier it becomes.",
      "love_up_past": "There's a deep sense that your love life underwent a complete transformation... An old connection, belief, or attachment died off, leaving behind emotional clarity. You may have loved, lost, and learned what your heart truly needs.",
      "love_up_present": "Something feels final in your romantic energy... You may be facing the end of a relationship or a radical change in how you give and receive love. Let it end with grace... because what comes next will be real, raw, and awakening.",
      "love_up_future": "There's an unavoidable shift coming in love... It may seem like loss, but the death of this phase will create the space for something more aligned. Release the illusion, and make room for the truth of the heart.",
      "love_rev_past": "You once held onto a love that had already ended... and in doing so, kept yourself trapped in mourning. That resistance still shapes how you relate and protect your heart today.",
      "love_rev_present": "Your romantic life is frozen... not in quiet peace, but in denial. The love may already be dead, but you're pretending it can still breathe. It's time to let go of the fantasy before it rots everything real.",
      "love_rev_future": "The longer you delay this romantic ending, the more painful it will become... A slow emotional decay may set in if you resist the shift that your soul already sees coming.",
      "career_up_past": "Your professional path was marked by an ending that forced you to start over... That moment, though painful, was the true beginning of your purpose. You're stronger now for what you walked away from.",
      "career_up_present": "There's a powerful transformation underway... You may be called to leave behind a role, a title, or an ambition that no longer resonates. This is the death of old goals... and the birth of deeper ones.",

      "career_rev_past": "There was a moment when you should have walked away... but fear of failure or identity kept you rooted. That choice may still be influencing your present stagnation.",
      "career_rev_present": "You're stuck in a job or ambition that has spiritually expired... You keep showing up out of habit, but your soul has already left the building. It's time to end this charade.",
      "career_rev_future": "If you don't make a career pivot soon... the change may be made for you. Forced layoffs, burnout, or internal collapse could be the result of avoiding the inevitable rebirth.",
      "finances_up_past": "You experienced a financial loss in the past that transformed your relationship with money... It taught you humility, value, and the ability to survive without excess.",
      "finances_up_present": "Right now, your financial life is ending a cycle... maybe you're closing accounts, paying off debts, or realizing the need to shift your entire budget. Let the old ways die to welcome stability.",
      "finances_up_future": "A financial change is coming... not to punish you, but to redirect you. You may lose something small to gain something lasting. Trust the process of rebirth in your money matters.",
      "finances_rev_past": "You once refused to change your financial habits when you knew you had to... That resistance may have created a long-term pattern of scarcity or regret.",
      "finances_rev_present": "You're holding onto a dying money mindset... whether through fear, greed, or illusion. You need to release the old habits before they calcify your future.",
      "finances_rev_future": "If you refuse to change your financial direction, you may experience a kind of economic paralysis... debt, dependence, or lost opportunities could haunt your steps.",
      "feelings_up_past": "Your emotional world was stripped down in the past... You faced a painful truth, surrendered to it, and emerged emotionally lighter. You died to an old version of yourself.",
      "feelings_up_present": "Emotionally, you are shedding skin... You may feel numb or distant, but that's part of the metamorphosis. Let your old emotional identity crumble so something new can emerge.",
      "feelings_up_future": "Soon, you'll undergo an emotional rebirth... but it will require letting go of a version of yourself you once clung to. This is not the end of feeling... it's the beginning of feeling true.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "You buried your feelings in the past rather than facing them... That choice created a slow numbness that may still linger in your emotional responses today.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "You're emotionally asleep... not from peace, but from avoidance. There is no growth without grief, and no healing without an honest goodbye.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "Avoiding your emotions will only deepen the emotional freeze... If you don't confront what you feel soon, it may become a numbness that consumes all joy.",
      "actions_up_past": "You took a brave action that led to an ending... but it was the right move. Ending things with clarity rather than dragging them out gave you the clean slate you needed.",
      "actions_up_present": "The best action now is to let something go... A door must close, and you're the one holding the key. This ending is your initiation, not your defeat.",
      "actions_up_future": "Soon, you'll need to take action that feels final... but that closure will unlock something more sacred and authentic. Trust that release is a form of creation.",
      "actions_rev_past": "You avoided an ending through inaction... and that choice kept you bound longer than you ever expected. It's time to acknowledge that delay and move forward.",
      "actions_rev_present": "You're acting out of fear... either doing nothing when change is needed, or scrambling to avoid letting go. Both paths lead to stagnation if you won't surrender.",
      "actions_rev_future": "If you don't consciously act to end something soon, the universe will act for you... and it may be more disruptive than if you had chosen the ending yourself."

      "desc": "A winged angel, with the sign of the sun upon his forehead and on his breast the square and triangle of the septenary. I speak of him in the masculine sense, but the figure is neither male nor female. It is held to be pouring the essences of life from chalice to chalice. It has one foot upon the earth and one upon waters, thus illustrating the nature of the essences. A direct path goes up to certain heights on the verge of the horizon, and above there is a great light, through which a crown is seen vaguely. Hereof is some part of the Secret of Eternal Life, as it is possible to man in his incarnation. All the conventional emblems are renounced herein.\nSo also are the conventional meanings, which refer to changes in the seasons, perpetual movement of life and even the combination of ideas. It is, moreover, untrue to say that the figure symbolizes the genius of the sun, though it is the analogy of solar light, realized in the third part of our human triplicity. It is called Temperance fantastically, because, when the rule of it obtains in our consciousness, it tempers, combines and harmonises the psychic and material natures. Under that rule we know in our rational part something of whence we came and whither we are going.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "Temperance graces your spread... and how fortunate you are to receive it upright. This is a rare sign of inner alignment, where moderation, balance, and mindful management shape your present. The angel pours the essence of life between chalices, blending extremes into something greater. With one foot in the waters of feeling and one on the ground of logic, this figure reminds you that harmony is an active choice. You're on the path of spiritual integration, where divine purpose flows through grounded decisions.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "Temperance appears reversed... and you must know how unlucky that is, for its fall warns of discord, disunity, and fractured purpose. The once-fluid flow between opposites is now blocked or misaligned. Competing interests pull you apart... spiritual ideals clash with real-world pressure. The chalices no longer pour into each other... they spill. The path to higher light is still there, but you're veering off-course, caught in the struggle between inner chaos and outer expectations.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "Your past reveals a time where you chose peace over pride, balance over chaos... and that choice shaped your current foundation.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "You are being called to blend your inner and outer worlds... to temper your fire with patience, your ambition with empathy. The answer lies in harmony, not haste.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "Soon, you will need to act with deep restraint... not because you're weak, but because you're wise. Your ability to balance extremes will unlock the path ahead.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "A lack of balance or spiritual misalignment colored your past... whether through overindulgence or clashing priorities, something sacred was lost in the noise.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "Right now, your energy feels scattered... You're trying to manage too many conflicting forces without giving space for real healing. Nothing blends unless you slow down.",

The Horned Goat of Mendes, with wings like those of a bat, is standing on an altar. At the pit of the stomach there is the sign of Mercury. The right hand is upraised and extended, being the reverse of that benediction which is given by the Hierophant in the fifth card. In the left hand there is a great flaming torch, inverted towards the earth. A reversed pentagram is on the forehead. There is a ring in front of the altar, from which two chains are carried to the necks of two figures, male and female. These are analogous with those of the fifth card, as if Adam and Eve after the Fall. Hereof is the chain and fatality of the material life.\nThe figures are tailed, to signify the animal nature, but there is human intelligence in the faces, and he who is exalted above them is not to be their master for ever. Even now, he is also a bondsman, sustained by the evil that is in him and blind to the liberty of service. With more than his usual derision for the arts which he pretended to respect and interpret as a master therein, √âliphas L√©vi affirms that the Baphometic figure is occult science and magic. Another commentator says that in the Divine world it signifies predestination, but there is no correspondence in that world with the things which below are of the brute. What it does signify is the Dweller on the Threshold without the Mystical Garden when those are driven forth therefrom who have eaten the forbidden fruit.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Devil stands chained at the altar of temptation... and yet you drew it upright, how curious and oddly fortunate for you. This card pulses with intensity, pointing to ravage, vehemence, and extraordinary efforts. Despite its dark cloak, the Devil upright reveals truths about force, inner compulsions, and the chains we pretend not to see. You may be staring at a moment where predestined paths and free will tangle like smoke... and you're meant to notice.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "You've drawn The Devil reversed... and how unfortunate that is. Shadows crawl a little deeper now. This card warns of evil fatality, petty self-deceptions, and blind spots you've refused to acknowledge. When reversed, The Devil speaks of chains that tighten the more you deny their weight. It whispers of weakness pretending to be strength and of blindness that passes as clarity. The altar is still here... but the light has dimmed.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "In the past, you were locked in a cycle of overexertion... perhaps you mistook intensity for progress. The Devil upright here suggests your energy was ravaged by something or someone... yet you pushed with everything you had, unaware how deep the toll ran.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, you're likely feeling the heat of temptation or the magnetism of something you know isn't wise... and yet, it pulls. The Devil tells you you're making powerful moves, but warns you to look at what's pulling your strings... and why you allow it.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "Ahead lies a confrontation... one with yourself. The Devil upright in the future shows your strength growing, but so does the risk of obsession or burnout. Will you tame the force, or will it turn on you? This is a test of power... and restraint.",

      "interpretation_rev_present": "Currently, you may feel lost in trivial matters or are consumed by petty fights. The Devil reversed here says you're blind to how small things are stealing your peace. There's no grand enemy... only tiny shadows breeding in corners you refuse to light up.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "The path forward warns of falling into old traps, though they may wear new faces. The Devil reversed in the future hints that blindness will not be forgiven... unless you start seeing clearly now. The question isn't who's holding you back... but why you still listen.",
      "love_up_past": "I feel a lingering intensity tied to your past relationships... The Devil upright in the past reveals a history of passionate but unhealthy entanglements. There may have been a connection that consumed more than it gave, holding you in place when you should have been free. It speaks of obsession or patterns of attachment that echoed long after the bond was broken.",
      "love_up_present": "Something heavy clings to your heartspace right now... The Devil upright in your present suggests you're in or near a toxic relationship, or perhaps struggling with temptation and control. It's a card of magnetic attraction laced with shadows... be wary of giving your power away.",

      "desc": "Occult explanations attached to this card are meagre and mostly disconcerting. It is idle to indicate that it depicts min in all its aspects, because it bears this evidence on the surface. It is said further that it contains the first allusion to a material building, but I do not conceive that the Tower is more or less material than the pillars which we have met with in three previous cases. I see nothing to warrant Papus in supposing that it is literally the fall of Adam, but there is more in favour of his alternative--that it signifies the materialization of the spiritual word. The bibliographer Christian imagines that it is the downfall of the mind, seeking to penetrate the mystery of God. I agree rather with Grand Orient that it is the ruin of the House of We, when evil has prevailed therein, and above all that it is the rending of a House of Doctrine. I understand that the reference is, however, to a House of Falsehood. It illustrates also in the most comprehensive way the old truth that \"except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.\"\nThere is a sense in which the catastrophe is a reflection from the previous card, but not on the side of the symbolism which I have tried to indicate therein. It is more correctly a question of analogy; one is concerned with the fall into the material and animal state, while the other signifies destruction on the intellectual side. The Tower has been spoken of as the chastisement of pride and the intellect overwhelmed in the attempt to penetrate the Mystery of God; but in neither case do these explanations account for the two persons who are the living sufferers. The one is the literal word made void and the other its false interpretation. In yet a deeper sense, it may signify also the end of a dispensation, but there is no possibility here for the consideration of this involved question.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Tower rises... only to fall. You're lucky it appeared upright, because now you're being warned and not blindsided. Misery, deception, and calamity echo through this card... but so too does a divine force that tears down lies, false beliefs, and egos built too high. From its shattered stones come truth, and in the rubble, a chance to build again... wiser, rawer, realer.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Tower stands crooked and reversed, and that's a harsh omen. You're unlucky to pull it this way, because its storm now brews in silence... oppression, tyranny, and spiritual collapse creep in rather than strike loud. It may not explode, but its weight is no less crushing. It speaks of mind twisted in pride, of truths bent into illusion, and of consequences deferred... not avoided.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "Something broke you once... a belief, a relationship, a self-image. But that collapse wasn't punishment... it was liberation from a lie that had long overstayed its welcome.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "What you've built is shaking. Expect a shock... a confrontation, a truth exposed, or a moment of absolute clarity that leaves you breathless. Don't fear the collapse... it's not chaos, it's alignment.",

      "interpretation_rev_present": "You're clinging to a crumbling tower, refusing to let it fall. That denial is the real danger. You may feel imprisoned by your own silence or someone else's lies.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "Avoidance will cost you. If you don't face the weak points now, the future holds a quiet implosion... no lightning, just slow suffocation under things you should've let go.",
      "love_up_past": "There's a heavy silence here... a collapse that reshaped what you thought love should be. The Tower says that something broke suddenly in the past... a betrayal, a truth exposed, or a relationship that ended without warning. It wasn't just heartbreak... it was a complete shattering of illusions.",
      "love_up_present": "Something about now feels unstable... like you're walking through emotional ruins hoping to find something intact. The Tower signals that a truth is hitting hard... a confrontation, a breakup, or a sudden realization about who you're with or what you want. The walls are falling... but what's being revealed beneath them is real.",
      "love_up_future": "A future moment may jolt you... shaking loose everything you thought was secure in your love life. The Tower doesn't bring gradual change... it brings lightning. That new relationship may not be what it seems, or your current one could be heading toward a difficult reckoning. What breaks will not return... but what's left will be honest.",
      "love_rev_past": "Something tried to collapse before... but you resisted it. A relationship should've ended, or the truth should've come out, but denial and fear held the structure together. The Tower reversed suggests you've been carrying the debris ever since.",
      "love_rev_present": "There's an eruption waiting just below the surface... one you may be trying to suppress. Reversed, The Tower warns of emotional suppression... secrets kept in a relationship, or truths avoided in your own heart. But the more you hold the tension, the harder the eventual explosion will be.",
      "love_rev_future": "The future holds the chance for a slow breakdown instead of an explosive one... but make no mistake, something will fall apart if ignored. The Tower reversed whispers of inevitable endings delayed... the question is, will you let go gracefully or cling until it burns?",
      "career_up_past": "There was a professional implosion behind you... a job loss, a failed venture, or the moment you realized the ladder you climbed was leaning against the wrong wall. The Tower doesn't just signal failure... it signals necessary destruction.",
      "career_up_present": "Right now, the ground under your career is trembling. The Tower warns of sudden changes at work... a restructuring, a revelation, or even getting fired. This isn't punishment... it's a forced realignment to get you away from what was false.",
      "career_up_future": "Prepare yourself... a major shake-up is coming. The Tower suggests your current path may not survive it... a promotion that turns into a burden, a company downfall, or realizing your purpose lies elsewhere entirely. The fall clears the way.",
      "career_rev_past": "A crisis at work may have been avoided before... but not without cost. Reversed, The Tower speaks of a job or project that survived collapse, but the rot still lingers beneath. You've rebuilt, but on shaky ground.",
      "career_rev_present": "You may be clinging to a job or identity that no longer fits. The Tower reversed tells you the collapse is slow but sure... and denial will only deepen the pain. Something is not sustainable... you feel it every day.",
      "career_rev_future": "If you keep ignoring the signs, the future will bring burnout or professional disillusionment. The Tower reversed doesn't take prisoners... it shows that the longer you wait, the harder the landing. Start planning the exit.",
      "finances_up_past": "An unexpected financial loss hit you like lightning... perhaps through deception, poor judgment, or circumstances beyond control. The Tower shows that the past brought ruin, but also revealed what was truly important.",
      "finances_up_present": "Right now... be cautious. The Tower warns of financial instability... unexpected expenses, investment losses, or a major financial structure breaking down. It's a time to let go of false security and start over.",
      "finances_up_future": "There's a risk of financial collapse ahead if you keep ignoring the signs. The Tower doesn't punish... it reveals. You may lose something you're clinging to, but in the aftermath you'll find freedom from dependence.",
      "finances_rev_past": "You dodged a financial disaster once... maybe through luck, or by avoiding responsibility. But the Tower reversed shows that the cracks remain. The issue wasn't solved... just buried.",
      "finances_rev_present": "You're avoiding a financial truth. Something's bleeding money or built on false hope. The Tower reversed whispers... 'Face this now, or it'll crush you later.'",
      "finances_rev_future": "Unless you make drastic changes, the future could bring a slow financial breakdown. The Tower reversed signals a delayed collapse... one that can still be prevented, but not without courage.",
      "feelings_up_past": "The past holds emotional devastation... a moment where everything inside you crumbled. The Tower says the breakdown wasn't weakness... it was the necessary fall before rebuilding something real.",

      "feelings_up_future": "Ahead, you may be forced to confront everything you've buried. The Tower doesn't wait. A moment will come that strips away emotional masks and demands honesty. Let the wave come... it carries renewal in its wake.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "You suppressed the breakdown. You should've let yourself cry, scream, release... but instead, you swallowed it whole. The Tower reversed says that pain has festered, waiting to be heard.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "You're numbing, denying, pretending it's all fine... but inside, the storm gathers. The Tower reversed urges you to feel it all. If you don't release, it'll erupt when you least expect it.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "Emotional collapse is coming, but you still have time. The Tower reversed warns that if you keep ignoring your feelings, the breakdown will come in isolation. Don't wait until it's too late to ask for help.",
      "actions_up_past": "You made a bold move once... and it all came crashing down. The Tower shows that your actions brought dramatic consequences, but they also freed you from illusion. You didn't fail... you cleared space.",
      "actions_up_present": "Whatever you're doing now is triggering change... fast, raw, irreversible. The Tower urges you to let the destruction finish. Something must fall so truth can rise.",
      "actions_up_future": "A decision you'll soon make will break old patterns in shocking ways. The Tower doesn't reward hesitation... it brings cleansing through chaos. If you act with honesty, the aftermath will bring growth.",
      "actions_rev_past": "You avoided acting when it mattered. The Tower reversed reveals regret... that one moment you wish you could return to. But the damage was done, even in your silence.",
      "actions_rev_present": "Right now, you may be trying to fix things without changing anything. The Tower reversed warns that avoidance is its own destruction. Face the consequences. Choose real action, not delay.",
      "actions_rev_future": "You're about to face a choice... take the leap or avoid it once more. The Tower reversed suggests that hesitation will only make things worse. What you refuse to do now may collapse your world later."

Her left knee is on the land and her right foot upon the water. She pours Water of Life from two great ewers, irrigating sea and land. Behind her is rising ground and on the right a shrub or tree, whereon a bird alights. The figure expresses eternal youth and beauty. The star is l'√©toile flamboyante, which appears in Masonic symbolism, but has been confused therein. That which the figure communicates to the living scene is the substance of the heavens and the elements. It has been said truly that the mottoes of this card are \"Waters of Life freely\" and \"Gifts of the Spirit.\"\nThe summary of several tawdry explanations says that it is a card of hope. On other planes it has been certified as immortality and interior light. For the majority of prepared minds, the figure will appear as the type of Truth unveiled, glorious in undying beauty, pouring on the waters of the soul some part and measure of her priceless possession. But she is in reality the Great Mother in the Kabalistic Sephira Binah, which is supernal Understanding, who communicates to the Sephiroth that are below in the measure that they can receive her influx.",

It brings a quiet but radiant energy... a promise that after hardship, hope still blooms. It speaks of bright prospects, inner renewal, and the return of light after loss. Connected to eternal youth, divine beauty, and the flowing 'Waters of Life,' this card whispers of spiritual gifts descending into your world, just as the naked figure freely pours essence into both land and sea.",

You're not so lucky to have drawn it this way, and it's important to know that. When this celestial guide turns upside down, it signals arrogance, impotence, and false confidence blocking your ability to receive. The beauty and truth it usually pours now feel distant... like a sky clouded over by ego or denial.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "There was a time when you were stripped bare of everything... and yet, somehow, you found a glimmer of hope. The Star upright here shows that your spirit healed through quiet faith and that your past trials became the soil for your inner light to grow.",

      "career_rev_past": "There's a bitter taste in this memory... like a time when you pursued success for the wrong reasons. The reversed Star suggests past pride or detachment from your deeper purpose cost you growth. It's time to understand the lesson.",
      "career_rev_present": "Right now it feels like you're doubting everything... the Star reversed in your career warns that burnout or ego-driven choices may be dulling your light. Reconnect with why you started in the first place. Clarity will return once humility does.",

      "desc": "The distinction between this card and some of the conventional types is that the moon is increasing on what is called the side of mercy, to the right of the observer. It has sixteen chief and sixteen secondary rays. The card represents life of the imagination apart from life of the spirit. The path between the towers is the issue into the unknown. The dog and wolf are the fears of the natural mind in the presence of that place of exit, when there is only reflected light to guide it.\nThe last reference is a key to another form of symbolism. The intellectual light is a reflection and beyond it is the unknown mystery which it cannot shew forth. It illuminates our animal nature, types of which are represented below--the dog, the wolf and that which comes up out of the deeps, the nameless and hideous tendency which is lower than the savage beast. It strives to attain manifestation, symbolized by crawling from the abyss of water to the land, but as a rule it sinks back whence it came. The face of the mind directs a calm gaze upon the unrest below; the dew of thought falls; the message is: Peace, be still; and it may be that there shall come a calm upon the animal nature, while the abyss beneath shall cease from giving up a form.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Moon glows with mystery and misdirection... This is a warning card, cloaked in shadows and uncertainty. Hidden enemies, looming danger, and creeping deception... These are its whispers. The imagery reveals a twilight path flanked by towers, where beasts howl at illusions and something unknown crawls from the depths. You're walking a road lit only by reflected truths... and not all is what it seems.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "Drawn in reverse, The Moon retreats into fog... An unlucky omen, though less severe than its upright form. You may be dancing with instability and quiet falsehoods. The subtle pull of silence and emotional tides could be distorting your perception. Even as deception fades slightly, the path ahead remains uncertain. The card warns of the mind's abyss, where things unsaid linger like shadows just out of reach.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "Your past is marked by a time when fear dictated your direction... Deception may have hidden itself behind smiles or silence. There was danger lurking beneath the surface, and perhaps you ignored the warning signs. The beasts of your mind howled, yet you mistook them for echoes of others.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "You are in a moment of confusion, possibly being misled by someone or something... Everything seems half-lit, unclear, dreamlike. This is not the time to trust first impressions or rush forward. Danger is close, though it wears a mask of familiarity. Let your instincts rise like the moon's pull on the tide.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "Ahead lies a test of faith through the fog... You may encounter someone whose intentions are veiled, or find yourself unsure of your own next move. The path will not be obvious, and you'll need to navigate by intuition alone. Trust will be tested... and illusions may break with a painful clarity.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "You've come from a time where uncertainty ruled, but it was less a storm than a quiet confusion... There may have been moments of silence instead of truth, and your own shifting moods blurred reality. Though deception was present, it slipped in softly, not harshly.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "Right now, you're walking between shifting moods and unstable ground... Things aren't exactly false, but they're not fully true either. What you feel may not match what is, and emotional tides are pulling you in several directions. The Moon reversed asks: what part of this are you avoiding seeing clearly?",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "A period of instability may arise... one where quiet lies or misunderstandings create emotional distance. The chaos won't be loud, but it will be real. A deceptive calm might tempt you to ignore your instincts, but doing so could lead you deeper into confusion. Stay still. Watch the waters. Something is surfacing soon.",
      "love_up_past": "A deep unease once clouded your heart... someone may have hidden truths or intentions behind their affection. The Moon warns that illusions shaped your past connections, and what you believed to be real may have only been a reflection of your hopes.",
      "love_up_present": "Your intuition is sounding the alarm... there's emotional fog surrounding your current connection. You may sense something off but can't quite grasp it. The Moon urges caution... what you feel might be true, even if there's no proof yet.",
      "love_up_future": "The path ahead in love is obscured... uncertainty and fantasy may tangle. Be wary of idealizing someone new. The Moon asks you to trust your gut more than words spoken under dim light.",
      "love_rev_past": "The emotional instability in your past may have come from your own fears rather than deception... the Moon reversed softens the shadows but leaves a residue. Perhaps you misread signs and pushed someone away.",
      "love_rev_present": "You're beginning to see the truth behind a confusing love situation... the illusions are cracking. The Moon reversed invites you to confront uncomfortable feelings so clarity can bloom.",
      "love_rev_future": "Unspoken doubts will rise again if left buried... the Moon reversed in future warns you to communicate clearly before shadows grow too strong to dispel.",
      "career_up_past": "A path you once followed in your career was built on false hopes... someone may have led you astray or promises were not as they seemed. The Moon whispers of manipulation hidden beneath ambition.",
      "career_up_present": "You may be walking blind in your work life... confusion, unclear goals, or hidden agendas are casting long shadows. Trust your instincts more than what's being presented.",
      "career_up_future": "If you continue down this path without seeking clarity, disappointment may greet you... The Moon's future warns of workplace deception or self-delusion around your professional potential.",
      "career_rev_past": "Past inconsistency in your work ethic or direction left you unsure of your place. The Moon reversed reveals you were battling your own illusions more than others'... perhaps you underestimated yourself.",
      "career_rev_present": "Some truth is beginning to surface... what was once hidden at work is becoming clear. The Moon reversed suggests it's time to break out of confusion and take steady action.",
      "career_rev_future": "You may still waver between directions... the Moon reversed in future warns that hesitation will only breed more uncertainty. Choose clarity over comfort.",
      "finances_up_past": "There was once a financial decision clouded by fantasy... perhaps you were misled or misinformed. The Moon hints at deception tied to money in your past.",
      "finances_up_present": "Something about your financial situation feels off... not all is being revealed to you. Be cautious with contracts, fine print, or offers that seem too good to be true.",
      "finances_up_future": "If you're not careful, a financial misstep looms... the Moon warns of losses through illusions or blind trust. Let intuition guide you away from temptation.",
      "finances_rev_past": "Financial inconsistency defined a period of your life... impulsive decisions may have stemmed from emotional instability. The Moon reversed urges reflection.",
      "finances_rev_present": "You're slowly beginning to understand your financial habits better... but be wary of repeating the same subtle errors. Awareness is rising, but the shadows still linger.",
      "finances_rev_future": "Improvement is possible... but only if you stay grounded. The Moon reversed in future shows clarity growing, but warns that one false step could send you back into confusion.",
      "feelings_up_past": "You've felt overwhelmed before... emotions surging in waves you couldn't explain. The Moon speaks of emotional deception, either from within or from someone close.",
      "feelings_up_present": "You're emotionally adrift... something inside you feels wrong, yet you can't place it. The Moon reveals this unease is valid... but the truth is murky and half-hidden.",
      "feelings_up_future": "An emotional revelation lies ahead... but not all of it will be comforting. The Moon warns that buried fears or suppressed feelings will resurface when you least expect.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "You once ignored your intuition... and it led to emotional imbalance. The Moon reversed shows emotional confusion caused by self-doubt.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "You're starting to trust your feelings again... the fog is thinning. The Moon reversed invites you to reflect rather than react.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "If you continue reflecting, emotional healing is possible. But if you keep avoiding your shadows, they'll follow you. The Moon reversed shows the tension between progress and emotional relapse.",
      "actions_up_past": "You've acted out of fear rather than clarity... the Moon reveals a time you chose paths that seemed right, but were based on illusion.",
      "actions_up_present": "Something is urging you to act... but be careful. The Moon advises waiting until the path is clearer. Acting now may only deepen the confusion.",
      "actions_up_future": "Your next move will define whether you escape the fog or sink deeper into it. The Moon warns that hasty or unclear action will attract unwanted consequences.",
      "actions_rev_past": "Your past inaction may have come from fear disguised as patience. The Moon reversed suggests hesitation kept you from breaking illusions.",
      "actions_rev_present": "You're gaining insight... starting to make clearer decisions. The Moon reversed supports action only when your instincts align with truth.",
      "actions_rev_future": "Soon, you'll be tested... will you act on what you now know, or will old fears resurface? The Moon reversed promises growth only if you act from clarity, not avoidance."

      "desc": "The naked child mounted on a white horse and displaying a red standard has been mentioned already as the better symbolism connected with this card. It is the destiny of the Supernatural East and the great and holy light which goes before the endless procession of humanity, coming out from the walled garden of the sensitive life and passing on the journey home. The card signifies, therefore, the transit from the manifest light of this world, represented by the glorious sun of earth, to the light of the world to come, which goes before aspiration and is typified by the heart of a child.\nBut the last allusion is again the key to a different form or aspect of the symbolism. The sun is that of consciousness in the spirit - the direct as the antithesis of the reflected light. The characteristic type of humanity has become a little child therein--a child in the sense of simplicity and innocence in the sense of wisdom. In that simplicity, he bears the seal of Nature and of Art; in that innocence, he signifies the restored world. When the self-knowing spirit has dawned in the consciousness above the natural mind, that mind in its renewal leads forth the animal nature in a state of perfect conformity.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Sun shines with unstoppable clarity and radiant joy... If this card has appeared upright, count yourself incredibly lucky. This is a sign of material happiness, a fortunate union, and deep contentment. Its light speaks of innocence reborn, the clarity of spirit over ego, and a return to the truest version of yourself... a self that shines effortlessly like a child bathed in love.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Sun appears, yet not in full blaze... Drawn in reverse, you're still blessed, but more subtly so. This card offers the same gifts, happiness, marriage, contentment, but in a lesser or delayed form. The child still rides, but the brilliance is filtered, like a cloudy day that hides a sky full of promise. There is still light... just less certainty.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "In your past, The Sun brought a period of warmth and growth... Moments of pure joy, emotional clarity, or a deep sense of being seen and celebrated surrounded you. Whatever shadow had lingered before, this card shows that the light returned... and perhaps, for a time, everything simply made sense.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, The Sun illuminates your life with purpose and peace... You're in a phase of alignment where your external and internal worlds are working in harmony. Love flows easily, efforts are rewarded, and optimism feels natural. This is your moment in the sun... bask in it fully.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "Soon, The Sun will rise over your horizon and clear away the last of the doubt... A time of success, honest connection, and emotional clarity is on its way. This will not be fleeting... it is the kind of happiness that rewires your beliefs about what life can offer. Prepare to feel truly alive.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "In the past, joy was there, but muted... The Sun reversed points to missed moments of happiness or celebration that never fully arrived. Perhaps you were too burdened to notice the good, or your light was dimmed by comparison, fear, or disbelief. The brightness never left... it just didn't reach you.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "At present, The Sun's energy still touches you, though clouds may block the full warmth... You're closer than you think to breakthrough, but something, doubt, fatigue, or an overreliance on others, dulls the effect. You may be smiling on the outside while yearning for something real beneath. It's okay to seek clarity.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "In the future, happiness is possible but will require effort to uncover... The Sun reversed doesn't deny success, but suggests you'll need to reclaim it... perhaps by redefining what joy means for you. Watch for signs of shallow victory or fleeting approval. Stay true to the childlike self that knows how to shine from within.",
      "love_up_past": "A deep warmth lingers when thinking of a past love... The Sun upright suggests you once experienced a connection so pure, it healed you. That relationship, whether romantic or soul-based, brought clarity, laughter, and a deep sense of being seen. It was a season of emotional brightness you still carry.",
      "love_up_present": "Something in your heart shines bright today... The Sun in the present means a joyful, radiant relationship is either blossoming or already illuminating your life. Vulnerability feels safe, mutual admiration flows naturally, and love becomes a shared celebration. This is a time when true affection needs no explanation.",
      "love_up_future": "A future love awaits that will feel like coming home... The Sun points toward a relationship that brings healing, laughter, and childlike ease. You'll feel more yourself than ever, and their presence will feel like daylight breaking through years of fog. Let your heart remain open... it's already being warmed.",
      "love_rev_past": "Love was there... but something dimmed it... The Sun reversed in your past shows a romance that should have sparked joy but left you uncertain. Perhaps fear, ego, or bad timing stole the fullness of that connection. It taught you that even love can struggle to shine in a shadowed heart.",
      "love_rev_present": "There's love around you, but you're struggling to feel it fully... The Sun reversed shows joy may be present, but something within you, fear of vulnerability, comparison, or unresolved wounds, keeps the full light at bay. Don't ignore what's good... but be honest about what's missing.",
      "love_rev_future": "Love is on its way, but you may second-guess its brightness... The Sun reversed warns of self-sabotage or the habit of shrinking yourself in new connections. A beautiful bond may begin, but it's up to you to let it fully warm your soul. Don't mistake comfort for happiness.",
      "career_up_past": "You've once experienced true fulfillment at work... The Sun upright reveals a phase in your past career where you felt recognized, inspired, and in alignment with your purpose. You shined, and others saw it. That moment still fuels your ambition today.",
      "career_up_present": "There's a strong sense of clarity in your work now... The Sun upright shows a time when passion and productivity align. You may be attracting attention or receiving long-deserved recognition. This is your time to lead with joy and let your efforts ripple outward.",
      "career_up_future": "Something brilliant is forming in your professional future... The Sun upright reveals success, promotion, or the ideal job... an opportunity that highlights your skills and rewards your optimism. You'll feel both competent and creative, with others gravitating toward your light.",
      "career_rev_past": "You've walked through jobs that looked bright but left you drained... The Sun reversed in your past career reveals missed opportunities or roles that promised growth but lacked authenticity. It shaped your understanding of what real success feels like... and what isn't worth the trade.",
      "career_rev_present": "Right now, you may feel underappreciated or directionless... The Sun reversed reveals a career phase where motivation is low or joy has faded. You might be performing well but feel unseen. It's time to re-light your purpose or step out of the shadow of someone else's vision.",
      "career_rev_future": "The path ahead brings success, but only if you realign with your true passion... The Sun reversed in your future warns of false positivity... perhaps chasing a job for the status, not fulfillment. Dig deeper. You're meant to shine, not survive.",
      "finances_up_past": "You've known the peace that comes from financial stability... The Sun upright in your financial past reveals a time of ease... where money flowed in balance and spending came from joy, not fear. That chapter gave you the wisdom to handle abundance with grace.",
      "finances_up_present": "Right now, the light of financial clarity is shining on you... The Sun upright brings rewards for responsible choices, possibly an unexpected gain or a period of smooth stability. Money may not be overwhelming in volume, but it feels aligned, free of guilt or pressure.",
      "finances_up_future": "A period of financial radiance is coming... The Sun upright suggests wealth may arrive... not just in numbers, but in freedom and joy. A decision made soon will unlock opportunities. Invest in your happiness, and prosperity will follow.",
      "finances_rev_past": "You've learned the hard way that money doesn't always equal joy... The Sun reversed in your financial past points to wasteful spending or relying on money for validation. That time taught you the difference between financial brightness and fleeting shine.",
      "finances_rev_present": "There's a sense of 'almost enough' right now... The Sun reversed suggests your finances are stable but you may not feel secure. Hidden costs or emotional spending could be undermining your peace. It's time to be honest about where your joy truly lies.",
      "finances_rev_future": "Money may come... but it won't fix everything... The Sun reversed in your financial future warns of overestimating a payout or attaching too much hope to material success. Wealth will arrive... but only if you stay grounded and intentional.",
      "feelings_up_past": "You've felt pure joy before and it still lives within you... The Sun upright suggests that at one point, your emotional world felt effortless. You radiated confidence, hope, and presence. That feeling was real... and it's not lost.",
      "feelings_up_present": "Your emotional world is glowing right now... The Sun upright means you're in a good place internally... feeling safe, expressive, and full of warmth. Your feelings match your actions, and that harmony creates true happiness. Let yourself feel it all.",
      "feelings_up_future": "Joy is on its way to your heart... The Sun in your future shows a coming season of confidence, emotional resilience, and childlike trust. Something beautiful will lift the fog inside you... and make your soul feel brighter than ever.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "There was a time you should've been happy... but weren't... The Sun reversed reflects emotional numbness in your past. You may have gone through joy externally while feeling detached inside. It taught you how important authenticity is.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "You may be smiling... but your soul craves more... The Sun reversed in the present shows you might be denying or minimizing your deeper emotional needs. You're close to joy... but need to be honest with yourself to fully reach it.",

      "actions_up_present": "Your actions today are aligned with your inner truth... The Sun upright says you're showing up fully... choosing what's right, joyful, and sustainable. Others are drawn to you because your energy is authentic. Keep following that light.",
      "actions_up_future": "Soon, you'll take action that feels like a soul breakthrough... The Sun upright promises you'll move from clarity, not pressure. The results will feel natural, like sunlight on your face after a long storm.",
      "actions_rev_past": "You once acted with good intentions but unclear motivation... The Sun reversed in your past suggests missed chances or hollow victories. You did what you thought would bring joy... but found it lacked substance. That lesson made you wiser.",
      "actions_rev_present": "Right now, your actions may seem bright but lack conviction... The Sun reversed warns that you might be performing joy instead of truly living it. Take a step back and ask... what would the child in me want to do right now?",
      "actions_rev_future": "Future decisions may be dressed in positivity... but test their roots... The Sun reversed cautions that you may rush into something believing it'll bring instant joy. Go slower. Real light doesn't fade when challenged."

      "desc": "I have said that this symbol is essentially invariable in all Tarot sets, or at least the variations do not alter its character. The great angel is here encompassed by clouds, but he blows his bannered trumpet, and the cross as usual is displayed on the banner. The dead are rising from their tombs--a woman on the right, a man on the left hand, and between them their child, whose back is turned. But in this card there are more than three who are restored, and it has been thought worth while to make this variation as illustrating the insufficiency of current explanations. It should be noted that all the figures are as one in the wonder, adoration and ecstacy expressed by their attitudes. It is the card which registers the accomplishment of the great work of transformation in answer to the summons of the Supernal--which summons is heard and answered from within.\nHerein is the intimation of a significance which cannot well be carried further in the present place. What is that within us which does sound a trumpet and all that is lower in our nature rises in response--almost in a moment, almost in the twinkling of an eye? Let the card continue to depict, for those who can see no further, the Last judgment and the resurrection in the natural body; but let those who have inward eyes look and discover therewith. They will understand that it has been called truly in the past a card of eternal life, and for this reason it may be compared with that which passes under the name of Temperance.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Last Judgment rises from the deck like a divine call... You're incredibly fortunate to pull this card upright, as it pulses with energy of renewal, transformation, and powerful change of position. This card doesn't just hint at outcome... it delivers it, often in an irreversible and life-altering way. The imagery of awakened souls answering the angel's trumpet connects to your own inner awakening... a moment where dormant truths are brought into the light.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Last Judgment falls reversed... and with it comes a sobering sense of uncertainty. You may be entering an unlucky phase where weakness and indecision cloud your path. While the trumpet still sounds, you may be struggling to respond. It suggests deliberation without conviction, a sentence passed yet not accepted... and you may find yourself stalled, unable to act while the moment slips through your fingers. The sacred imagery remains, but its call fades when fear overrides transformation.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "In the past position, The Last Judgment reveals a time when a profound awakening shifted your path. Perhaps you experienced a spiritual rebirth or had to make a life-changing decision... one that felt divinely timed. You answered a call that others might have ignored, and now everything after has been shaped by that choice.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, The Last Judgment speaks of a reckoning... not in punishment, but in realization. You're being asked to rise, to accept a new role or embrace a transformation long in the making. This is your moment to be seen for who you truly are. Listen closely to what life is demanding of you, because ignoring it won't silence the trumpet.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "A dramatic shift lies ahead... The Last Judgment in your future signals a clean break from the past. Something buried will rise again, and you'll have the chance to renew or destroy depending on your response. Whether it's a second chance, a final decision, or karmic return, this is your time to step forward and face it.",

The Last Judgment reversed hints at a time when you hesitated instead of acting, perhaps due to self-doubt or fear of the unknown. The moment passed, but its echoes remain, reminding you of the power in decisions you chose not to make.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "Right now, there's a paralysis within you... The Last Judgment reversed in this moment warns that you're resisting a necessary change. You're deliberating endlessly, fearing the outcome more than the stagnation. But life won't wait forever. Ignoring the call only amplifies the consequences later.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "Ahead lies a test... The Last Judgment reversed in the future foretells a critical moment where your strength may falter. You might be forced to confront decisions you delayed, or face the results of staying silent too long. The opportunity to rise again will come... but only if you dare to respond this time.",
      "love_up_past": "A deep karmic pull radiates from your past relationships... The Last Judgment upright reveals you once reunited with someone who felt like destiny, a love resurrected from what seemed lost. That union transformed your view of connection, shaking you awake to what love can demand and offer when it returns from silence.",
      "love_up_present": "There's an unmistakable signal echoing in your heart... The Last Judgment upright signals reconciliation or a powerful realization in love.

      "love_up_future": "A divine reunion awaits you... The Last Judgment upright in your future suggests a soul connection returning when you least expect. This love may be someone from your past or a new person who feels strangely familiar... because they're meant to trigger a profound awakening in you.",

The Last Judgment reversed warns of missed chances, emotional unavailability, or a karmic cycle repeating itself if you don't awaken. A test is coming... how you respond shapes everything.",
      "career_up_past": "A moment of professional reckoning lies behind you... The Last Judgment upright shows you answered a career calling that set you on a new path. Whether it was a bold move, leaving a job, or pursuing a passion, that decision shaped your current identity.",
      "career_up_present": "The trumpet is blaring... The Last Judgment upright in career means you're being noticed. It could be recognition, a promotion, or even a life-altering opportunity demanding your courage. This isn't the time to play small... rise to the moment.",
      "career_up_future": "A career revival is on the horizon... The Last Judgment upright in the future suggests a powerful shift that redefines your purpose. It could be switching fields, a major offer, or turning your passion into a profession. Destiny is preparing a door... will you walk through?",
      "career_rev_past": "Your career once faced a crossroad... and indecision stole the moment. The Last Judgment reversed shows hesitation or fear held you back. That path wasn't taken, but its lessons remain unfinished.",
      "career_rev_present": "You're stuck in a loop of doubt... The Last Judgment reversed in career suggests you're avoiding a bold decision that could reshape your trajectory. The more you delay, the heavier the weight becomes. It's time to face what you've been dodging.",
      "career_rev_future": "Ahead lies a critical moment... The Last Judgment reversed warns that if you don't seize it, you may be left with regret. You might miss an offer or sabotage your own progress by second-guessing. Be ready to act or the chance may never return.",

      "desc": "With light step, as if earth and its trammels had little power to restrain him, a young man in gorgeous vestments pauses at the brink of a precipice among the great heights of the world; he surveys the blue distance before him-its expanse of sky rather than the prospect below. His act of eager walking is still indicated, though he is stationary at the given moment; his dog is still bounding. The edge which opens on the depth has no terror; it is as if angels were waiting to uphold him, if it came about that he leaped from the height. His countenance is full of intelligence and expectant dream. He has a rose in one hand and in the other a costly wand, from which depends over his right shoulder a wallet curiously embroidered. He is a prince of the other world on his travels through this one-all amidst the morning glory, in the keen air. The sun, which shines behind him, knows whence he came, whither he is going, and how he will return by another path after many days. He is the spirit in search of experience. Many symbols of the Instituted Mysteries are summarized in this card, which reverses, under high warrants, all the confusions that have preceded it.\nIn his Manual of Cartomancy, Grand Orient has a curious suggestion of the office of Mystic Fool, as apart of his process in higher divination; but it might call for more than ordinary gifts to put it into operation. We shall see how the card fares according to the common arts of fortune-telling, and it will be an example, to those who can discern, of the fact, otherwise so evident, that the Trumps Major had no place originally in the arts of psychic gambling, when cards are used as the counters and pretexts. Of the circumstances under which this art arose we know, however, very little. The conventional explanations say that the Fool signifies the flesh, the sensitive life, and by a peculiar satire its subsidiary name was at one time the alchemist, as depicting folly at the most insensate stage.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Fool dances at the edge of everything... A card of untamed potential and enchanted recklessness. This is neither luck nor misfortune... it is something wilder. It speaks of folly, frenzy, and intoxicating beginnings. With eyes full of dreams and feet unaware of the cliff's edge, he symbolizes a boundless spirit in search of experience. The rose in his hand, the sun at his back, and the leaping dog suggest freedom, sacred naivety, and a cosmic trust in the journey ahead.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Fool reversed tumbles into a strange stillness... Where wild beginnings sour into carelessness and absence. Unlucky in the sense that nothing quite sticks, this card signals vanity and apathy draining the spirit's edge. He has stepped beyond the realm of experience into a void of nullity. That same dog once playful now snaps. The sun does not illuminate but blinds. Where once there was eager movement, now there is the weight of missed meaning and directionless drifting.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "You once leapt without a plan, and life rushed in to catch you. There was madness, maybe even missteps, but it awakened something in you... a freedom you couldn't deny. That era of spontaneous choices shaped who you are, even if it left a few scars.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, you're on the cusp of something wild... and you may not even see it. The Fool stands behind you, urging you to let go of the fear of failure. Begin. Say yes. Trust your gut even if others call you reckless... this moment holds a magic that only na√Øvet√© can unlock.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "A curious path is unfolding... one you never would have mapped out. If you embrace the unknown with open eyes and a wild heart, you'll find not just new adventures but a new version of yourself. Trust where your feet take you... even if it looks foolish now.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "There was a time you acted out of impulse, not inspiration... and the fallout may still echo today. Carelessness or apathy veiled your journey. What seemed harmless back then turned hollow. Yet even in that misstep, a truth about yourself was uncovered.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "You may be drifting without clarity... chasing distractions instead of purpose. The Fool reversed warns you're ignoring a crucial calling. This isn't the time to act on whim or deny the weight of your choices. Pause. Reflect. Anchor yourself before taking another step.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "If you keep walking without direction, you're at risk of losing more than your way. The future holds vanity or emptiness unless you turn inward and reclaim your intent. Don't mistake aimlessness for freedom. Only when you walk with vision will the path become true.",
      "love_up_past": "There's a warm sense that love once caught you off guard... a leap into passion without knowing where it would land. You followed your heart, not your head, and that spontaneity created a romance full of color and chaos. Whether it lasted or not, it awakened your belief in possibility.",
      "love_up_present": "Right now your heart flutters with potential... someone, or something, is inviting you to begin again with wide-eyed hope. The Fool whispers to trust, even if there's no plan. Love doesn't always need logic... it sometimes needs only courage and wonder.",
      "love_up_future": "There's a thrilling unpredictability in your romantic future... someone unexpected may cross your path and stir your soul in ways you didn't foresee. The Fool asks you not to fear vulnerability. Say yes to what feels impossible and love may surprise you with a whole new story.",
      "love_rev_past": "Something once felt like love, but it lacked grounding... you might have mistaken excitement for intimacy or chased someone who mirrored your own chaos. The Fool reversed reminds you how naivety turned into heartbreak... and how that pain taught you to seek truth over thrills.",
      "love_rev_present": "There's a quiet disconnection in the air... maybe you're avoiding love or acting aloof to protect yourself. The Fool reversed warns that this indifference may cost you a deeper connection. Love calls for risk... even when the path ahead is uncertain.",
      "love_rev_future": "If you're not careful, a future romance may be built on fantasy or avoidance. The Fool reversed brings a caution: don't fall for the illusion of love or run from its work. You must meet love not with dreamy denial, but with an open and aware heart.",
      "career_up_past": "A bold decision or unexpected career path once led you somewhere profound... even if it didn't seem wise at the time. You followed inspiration rather than convention and discovered hidden skills in the process. That leap shaped your professional foundation.",
      "career_up_present": "You stand on the edge of a new job, project, or creative pursuit... and it's not what you expected. The Fool says go. There's magic in doing what lights you up, even if it's uncertain. Trust your instincts and let passion guide the way.",
      "career_up_future": "A career pivot is coming... not out of logic, but out of longing. The Fool promises this new direction will challenge and delight you. Step into the unknown with confidence, and watch doors open you didn't even know existed.",
      "career_rev_past": "You may have once chased a job or ambition without truly knowing why... and now the consequences weigh on you. The Fool reversed reflects burnout, missteps, or chasing status without fulfillment. But those detours helped reveal what actually matters in your work.",
      "career_rev_present": "Stagnation or carelessness may be creeping into your career... you might be ignoring signs to change course. The Fool reversed urges you to look at your patterns. Are you coasting on autopilot? This is your wake-up call to get intentional about your path.",
      "career_rev_future": "If you continue to ignore your deeper calling, your future career may feel hollow or misaligned. The Fool reversed predicts aimless job-hopping or missed opportunities unless you reconnect to purpose. Find your 'why' again before taking the next step.",
      "finances_up_past": "You once spent freely, trusting the universe would catch you... and sometimes, it did. Your past financial decisions were fueled by belief, not spreadsheets. The Fool reveals how those moments taught you to value experience over security, even at a cost.",
      "finances_up_present": "There's a sense of freedom and lightness around your finances right now... maybe you're investing in something risky or starting fresh. The Fool says don't let fear freeze you... just be mindful. There's fortune in following your gut, so long as you stay aware.",
      "finances_up_future": "An unexpected opportunity or expense is on the horizon. The Fool says embrace it... this is a chance to invest in something meaningful, even if it defies logic. Your future financial path isn't about hoarding... it's about trusting flow and building abundance with intention.",
      "finances_rev_past": "Past financial carelessness may have caught up to you... impulse spending or neglect may have led to instability. The Fool reversed reminds you that lessons from those setbacks taught you how to be wiser with your resources.",
      "finances_rev_present": "You may be ignoring red flags or drifting financially... the Fool reversed warns of avoidable losses or waste. This isn't about fear... it's about becoming conscious. Start tracking, planning, and facing your finances head-on before chaos sets in.",
      "finances_rev_future": "If you continue to avoid financial responsibility, the road ahead may be filled with scarcity or regret. The Fool reversed calls for a shift in habits. Let go of fantasy and commit to clarity so your future self can thrive.",
      "feelings_up_past": "There was a time you felt weightless... your emotions were spontaneous, raw, and real. The Fool in your past shows how you once expressed joy and sorrow without filters. That emotional freedom helped you connect deeply, even if it led to moments of hurt.",
      "feelings_up_present": "Your heart feels open, like it's ready to explore again. You may be sensing a strange mix of hope and excitement bubbling beneath the surface. The Fool says let your emotions move through you without judgment... it's okay to feel it all, wildly and deeply.",
      "feelings_up_future": "A wave of emotional rebirth is coming... you'll feel liberated from old wounds and able to laugh, cry, and love with unfiltered truth. The Fool leads you into emotional territory where vulnerability is not weakness but freedom.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "You once suppressed your feelings or mistook recklessness for freedom. The Fool reversed reveals a past where emotional avoidance led to confusion or numbness. You may still be unpacking those buried storms.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "Right now, you may be emotionally checked out... numbing, ignoring, or pretending you're fine when you're not. The Fool reversed urges you to stop drifting... feelings don't vanish by being ignored. Acknowledge what's stirring before it erupts.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "Unchecked emotional detachment may lead to loneliness or confusion ahead. The Fool reversed warns that unless you start tuning inward, your future emotional world may feel hollow. Reconnect with your heart before it hardens.",
      "actions_up_past": "You once acted with boldness and zero hesitation... that fearlessness brought both brilliant wins and wild mistakes. The Fool celebrates that era... those risks built your courage muscle, even if they didn't all land.",
      "actions_up_present": "You're being asked to act without overthinking... there's something calling your name, and The Fool says leap. Not recklessly... but with soulful conviction. Begin now. The timing will never be more perfect than this.",
      "actions_up_future": "Soon, you'll be offered a chance to act spontaneously... and it could change everything. The Fool promises a moment when action defies logic but aligns with destiny. Trust it. Your future self will thank you for daring.",
      "actions_rev_past": "You may have taken actions that lacked follow-through... starting things without finishing them. The Fool reversed reminds you how impulsive steps without vision led to burnout or regret. Those memories still shape how you move today.",
      "actions_rev_present": "You're hesitating or acting out of avoidance... the Fool reversed warns that inaction or aimless motion may sabotage your progress. Check your motives. Are you running toward something... or just running?",
      "actions_rev_future": "If you continue acting without intention, you may circle back to the same cycles. The Fool reversed says the future demands thoughtful action. You can still be bold... but grounded boldness will carry you farther than flailing energy ever could."

      "desc": "As this final message of the Major Trumps is unchanged--and indeed unchangeable--in respect of its design, it has been partly described already regarding its deeper sense. It represents also the perfection and end of the Cosmos, the secret which is within it, the rapture of the universe when it understands itself in God. It is further the state of the soul in the consciousness of Divine Vision, reflected from the self-knowing spirit. But these meanings are without prejudice to that which I have said concerning it on the material side.\nIt has more than one message on the macrocosmic side and is, for example, the state of the restored world when the law of manifestation shall have been carried to the highest degree of natural perfection. But it is perhaps more especially a story of the past, referring to that day when all was declared to be good, when the morning stars sang together and all the Sons of God shouted for joy. One of the worst explanations concerning it is that the figure symbolizes the Magus when he has reached the highest degree of initiation; another account says that it represents the absolute, which is ridiculous. The figure has been said to stand for Truth, which is, however, more properly allocated to the seventeenth card. Lastly, it has been called the Crown of the Magi.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The World completes the Fool's journey with a triumphant stillness... If you've drawn this upright, consider yourself blessed. This is a card of assured success, of crossing thresholds with grace, of changes embraced rather than feared. You may be relocating, shifting life paths, or finally receiving long-overdue rewards. There's cosmic harmony at play here... the sense that everything has aligned at last, mirroring the divine perfection spoken of in the card's deeper symbology.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The World in reverse holds back its full glory... and that's a sign to pause. Where upright it brings movement and triumph, reversed it speaks of stagnation, a refusal to let go, and the fear of change. Inertia may be keeping you locked in place... despite a universe urging you to expand. You may be clinging to cycles that should have closed, resisting the divine rhythm of progress described in this card's sacred vision.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "In the past position, The World upright marks a time when you reached the summit of a goal... and something in you changed. You may have moved cities, ended a major chapter, or experienced closure that elevated you spiritually. That moment still echoes in your life as a blessing fulfilled.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, The World brings powerful confirmation... you are exactly where you're meant to be. Whether it's career, relationships, or inner growth, all forces are aligning. You may be wrapping up a major cycle or standing at the threshold of joyful completion. Savor this rare harmony.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "Soon, a final piece will fall into place... and it will make the entire journey make sense. The World upright in the future heralds success, closure, and possibly a major move or transformation. Something is preparing to blossom into its most complete form... don't resist the shift.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "Once, you had the chance to step through a door... but you hesitated. The World reversed in your past suggests missed opportunities, unfinished stories, or a time when comfort outweighed progress. That moment may still anchor parts of your soul in stillness.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "This moment may feel heavy with repetition... as if nothing is really moving. The World reversed warns of being stuck in cycles, held back by fear or attachment to outdated goals. You're being called to release what's complete, but you may not be ready to listen yet.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "Ahead lies a test... will you choose growth, or cling to what's familiar? The World reversed in the future can mean delays, stagnation, or resisting a breakthrough that would liberate you. You may need to break the chain yourself before the universe does it for you.",
      "love_up_past": "There's a deep sense that something once felt whole... A love that had reached its full bloom and maybe even completion. This may have been a soulmate chapter, one that taught you everything you needed to know at the time. The World upright in your past suggests you've already known a love that expanded your soul... even if it ended, it ended in grace.",
      "love_up_present": "You're standing in the glow of real emotional fulfillment... or you're about to. The World here signals a partnership that feels destined, mutual, and deeply nourishing. If single, you're likely in a place of self-love so complete it magnetizes the right kind of connection. Something beautiful is either blossoming... or you're fully ready for it now.",
      "love_up_future": "There's an undeniable vibration in your heart space... a coming full circle. A romantic cycle is reaching its zenith. Whether it's reunion, commitment, or a peaceful closure, The World upright in the future shows a love story finding harmony. It's the kind of outcome that leaves you changed, whole, and ready for what's next.",
      "love_rev_past": "You once held the promise of something lasting... but it never got to bloom fully. The World reversed in love suggests a relationship that stopped short of its true potential... perhaps due to fear, distance, or a refusal to grow. The emotional echoes of that stagnation may still linger.",
      "love_rev_present": "You may feel like you're repeating patterns in love... stuck on a wheel that never finishes spinning. The World reversed signals emotional resistance to closure or new beginnings. If you're in a relationship, one or both of you may be avoiding the truth. If single, your heart may be caught in past loops you haven't fully acknowledged yet.",
      "love_rev_future": "There's a hesitance to take the next step... even if love is present. In the future, The World reversed warns of delays in commitment or emotional fulfillment. A lesson in self-worth may need to be completed first. Don't ignore signs of inertia... or you might get stuck watching love pass you by.",
      "career_up_past": "There's a sense of pride lingering from a major achievement... a milestone you reached that shaped your professional identity. The World upright says you've already closed a meaningful chapter in your career. It may have involved a promotion, career shift, or even leaving something behind that no longer aligned.",
      "career_up_present": "Right now, everything feels connected... You've either found your purpose or are standing at the edge of it. The World upright brings recognition, long-awaited results, or the culmination of years of effort. This moment may feel surreal... but it's exactly what you worked for.",
      "career_up_future": "There's momentum building around you... soon, you'll cross into a completely new career space. Whether through travel, promotion, or creative expansion, The World in the future means you're graduating to the next level. All efforts will converge in your favor... but you must embrace the shift fully.",
      "career_rev_past": "You may have stayed in a job too long... or ignored signs it was time to move on. The World reversed in the past suggests missed opportunities or fears around success. There was a cycle that begged to close, but you resisted... and it's shaped how you approach your goals now.",
      "career_rev_present": "You're probably feeling like nothing's moving forward... like your potential is trapped under routine or doubt. The World reversed points to professional stagnation, or perhaps burnout. You may be too focused on the end goal and forgetting to release what's no longer fueling your growth.",
      "career_rev_future": "If you don't act soon, you'll miss the window... The World reversed in the future suggests a delay in progress because of fear or perfectionism. You might sabotage success by refusing to evolve or leave behind outdated ambitions. Something will need to break the cycle for you to ascend.",
      "finances_up_past": "There's a moment in your financial past that changed everything... perhaps a windfall, a major sale, or finally reaching stability. The World upright shows that you once felt secure, in control, and complete in your material life. That legacy may still be supporting you today.",
      "finances_up_present": "Right now, things may finally feel balanced... as if every debt, investment, or habit has aligned. The World upright signals a healthy flow of abundance. You may be closing out old financial cycles and stepping into a freer, more confident state of wealth.",
      "finances_up_future": "Something big is coming... the kind of financial completion that opens new doors. The World here suggests you'll soon master your finances or reach a long-term goal. Whether it's retirement, debt freedom, or moving abroad, abundance is becoming tangible.",
      "finances_rev_past": "There's a memory of staying stuck in scarcity... even when a breakthrough was possible. The World reversed reveals a past of clinging to financial habits that limited your growth. You may have feared change or doubted your worthiness of wealth... and that fear shaped your path.",
      "finances_rev_present": "You might be feeling stuck in a paycheck-to-paycheck loop... or simply unable to close out cycles like debt or overspending. The World reversed warns that something in your mindset is resisting abundance. Financial clarity is possible... but only if you're ready to let go of old beliefs.",
      "finances_rev_future": "The road to wealth could stall if you don't embrace change... The World reversed in the future predicts delays, missed opportunities, or clinging to old methods. If you resist the necessary shift, you may stay locked in financial patterns that feel permanent.",
      "feelings_up_past": "There was once a moment when you felt utterly complete... whole within yourself. The World in your emotional past reflects a time of inner peace, self-love, and acceptance. That experience may still guide your instincts even when life feels uncertain.",

      "feelings_rev_past": "You may have repressed your feelings to avoid change... The World reversed in your emotional past speaks to times when growth was possible, but you feared what you'd feel if you let go. That reluctance may still be echoing today.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "Emotionally, something feels unfinished... you're circling the same themes, perhaps with different faces. The World reversed warns that you haven't let yourself feel something fully... and until you do, you won't move forward.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "If you don't confront what you've been avoiding... emotional closure may remain out of reach. The World reversed suggests emotional stagnation on the horizon. A cycle in your heart must end for new joy to begin.",
      "actions_up_past": "You once took a step that changed everything... a courageous action that led to the completion of a cycle. The World upright in your past shows that you followed through, honored the process, and came out stronger. That was a soul-level win.",
      "actions_up_present": "Now is the time to act with finality... to wrap up, release, and move with conviction. The World upright urges you to finish what you started. Your actions now will seal the cycle and clear space for true transformation.",
      "actions_up_future": "The actions you'll take soon will bring everything full circle... One final decision or move will initiate completion and triumph. Whether it's quitting, graduating, or committing, it will align your path with your soul's rhythm.",
      "actions_rev_past": "You once refused to act when the moment called for it... and the cycle remained open. The World reversed in your past shows avoidance, procrastination, or fear-based inaction. That karmic thread may still be unraveling.",
      "actions_rev_present": "You're hesitating to close the loop... even though everything within you knows it's time. The World reversed warns that passivity now may cost you peace later. Your current indecision is only stretching a cycle that's already complete.",
      "actions_rev_future": "If you don't take that leap... you may stay locked in a loop far longer than needed. The World reversed signals a future where action is delayed, and transformation stalls. The moment will come, but you'll have to be the one to choose it."

      "meaning_rev": "Rupture, division, interruption, discord.",
      "desc": "He is shewn as if upon a journey, armed with a short wand, and although mailed is not on a warlike errand. He is passing mounds or pyramids. The motion of the horse is a key to the character of its rider, and suggests the precipitate mood, or things connected therewith.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Knight of Wands gallops into your reading with a fiery momentum... This is a lucky omen if you've been seeking change, movement, or new beginnings. It speaks of departure, flight, and emigration... the kind that signals a restless heart ready to explore. You may feel the stirring of a journey... not just physical but something that shifts your whole life rhythm. Picture a young man charging forward not to fight, but to escape what no longer fuels him... this is the energy you're being called to embody.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Knight of Wands reversed crashes into your path like a warning from a storm ahead... This is an unlucky card if you've been hoping for smooth transitions. It brings rupture, division, and interruption... situations that splinter your plans or your resolve. The journey you thought you were on may now feel delayed or broken. The horse bucks beneath you, not in movement but in protest... there's discord in the momentum, and it may come from within.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "Your past was marked by a period of rapid change... whether it was a move, a breakup, or a bold leap of faith. You didn't linger when the fire sparked... you acted fast, maybe even without full certainty. But that heat... it got you somewhere new, even if the ground was unfamiliar.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, you are either preparing to move or are already in motion. This could be literal travel or something more symbolic like leaving behind a job, home, or mindset. The universe backs your boldness... but only if it comes from clarity rather than impulse.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "Ahead of you lies a powerful opportunity to break free from stagnation. A sudden chance, a call to leave, or a personal transformation may appear. It will come swiftly and require courage... hesitate too long, and it may pass you by.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "There was a time when action turned chaotic. A plan interrupted, a connection severed, or a road that split without warning. You may still carry the disorientation from that rupture... but it's part of your story now, and part of what hardened your resolve.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "Discord surrounds your current momentum. Either you're pushing ahead without direction, or you're being pulled in multiple directions at once. Watch for conflict in decisions... not all movement is progress, especially when done out of frustration.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "If you charge ahead recklessly, a fracture is likely to occur. A move made in haste or anger may lead to division you didn't intend. Be wary of the temptations to escape rather than confront. Sometimes standing still is braver than the flight.",
      "love_up_past": "There's a lingering sense that your past relationships were fueled by intense sparks and sudden decisions... The Knight of Wands rides in with memories of whirlwind romances, possibly passionate but short-lived. You may have loved boldly, maybe even recklessly, and the thrill left echoes in your heart. It was real... even if it didn't last.",
      "love_up_present": "Your love life feels electric right now... fast-paced, adventurous, maybe even a bit chaotic. You might be pursuing someone with fiery energy, or you're the one on the move. Either way, passion burns... but you'll need to decide if it's fire that sustains or fire that scorches.",
      "love_up_future": "Soon, a passionate encounter or bold romantic move is on the horizon. It could be someone new who sweeps in and sets your world alight... or a moment where you throw caution aside and go after what (or who) you want. Just be sure you're not chasing a flame that won't stay lit.",
      "love_rev_past": "There's a sense of romantic disarray in your history... broken promises, love interrupted by outside forces, or a deep connection fractured by impulsive choices. The reversed Knight of Wands suggests a lover who left or was never truly grounded.",
      "love_rev_present": "Right now, things may feel unstable in love... arguments, distance, or a partner who's all motion but no direction. You may be questioning someone's loyalty or your own motives. Are you escaping something, or chasing something real?",
      "love_rev_future": "If you continue on this current path, your love life may face a rupture... a sudden breakup, a dramatic shift, or a feeling of being left behind. Be cautious of lovers who arrive fast and leave faster... not every thrill is meant to last.",
      "career_up_past": "In your past, a bold career move changed everything. Maybe you relocated, switched industries, or jumped at an offer with little hesitation. It was risky... but it taught you how to move forward when your gut said go.",
      "career_up_present": "Your work energy right now is dynamic... possibly overwhelming. You may be called to take on more, lead a bold project, or even consider a major shift. You're being driven by ambition and restlessness... trust your drive, but don't let it burn you out.",

      "career_rev_past": "Something in your career journey didn't unfold as expected... maybe you jumped too soon, or were caught in workplace politics. The reversal shows discord from a move that wasn't fully thought through.",
      "career_rev_present": "You may feel blocked, or like you're pushing without getting anywhere. Impulsivity or external disruptions could be throwing off your focus. Slow down... not every opportunity is urgent.",
      "career_rev_future": "Caution... a rushed decision or a tempting offer could lead to professional regret. Watch for deals that seem too good to be true, or partners who aren't aligned with your vision.",
      "finances_up_past": "A financial decision from your past possibly involving relocation, investment, or a sudden expense... it created a shift in your monetary flow. You took a chance, and while it may not have been perfect, it propelled growth.",
      "finances_up_present": "Right now your money is in motion. You may be spending more due to travel, moving, or changes in your lifestyle. It's a time to stay alert and manage the speed of your financial choices.",
      "finances_up_future": "An upcoming change could alter your financial landscape quickly. Be it a new income stream, a move, or a big purchase, your ability to act swiftly but wisely will determine the outcome.",
      "finances_rev_past": "In the past, impulsive financial actions may have created instability... loans taken without planning, moving costs that spiraled, or overspending on a bold idea. You've felt that burn before.",
      "finances_rev_present": "Your money situation may be rocky due to a lack of structure. There's a feeling of pushing ahead with spending or risking too much without a grounded plan. Pause and regroup before you act.",
      "finances_rev_future": "Be cautious with your wallet... a rushed or emotionally driven financial decision could lead to discord. It's not the time for reckless investments or moving money without clarity.",
      "feelings_up_past": "In the past, you were led by a burning need to move on... your emotions didn't want to sit still. Whether from heartbreak or inspiration, your feelings propelled you forward in ways others may not have understood.",
      "feelings_up_present": "Your heart feels urgent right now... there's fire in your chest to break free, to act, to pursue. You're not in a reflective state... you're ready to run. Just make sure your actions match your deeper truths.",
      "feelings_up_future": "Soon, your emotional state will demand boldness. Whether it's leaving someone, confessing something, or choosing yourself first, your feelings will ignite action... and you'll be ready.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "There was a time you acted on feelings that weren't fully processed... resulting in broken connections or emotional fallout. It may still echo now... a reminder of what acting in haste can bring.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "Emotionally, you feel out of sync. You want change, but you're uncertain if it comes from real need or just inner chaos. There's a push-pull inside you... take time to sort what's truth and what's escape.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "If you let impulsive emotions take the wheel, things could splinter... a fight, a withdrawal, or an emotional rupture. Ground yourself before charging into confessions or ultimatums.",
      "actions_up_past": "You once made a decisive move that changed your world... it may have surprised others, but it was exactly what your spirit needed. This action echoes in who you've become.",
      "actions_up_present": "Right now, you're being called to move. Whether physically or metaphorically, action is needed and the path is open. Just be sure you're moving toward something, not away from discomfort.",
      "actions_up_future": "The next chapter of your life will begin with a single bold act... and the courage to follow through. You'll soon be faced with a decision to leap... the time will come quickly, and your readiness will shape the outcome.",
      "actions_rev_past": "You took a path once that fractured more than it built. A rash decision or an act of rebellion left marks... maybe even regrets. But it also taught you where your limits lie.",
      "actions_rev_present": "Your current actions may feel unaligned... lots of motion but little meaning. You're acting, but are you aiming? Slow down and assess... not all fire leads somewhere warm.",
      "actions_rev_future": "You may be tempted soon to act out of urgency... but beware. A single impulsive decision could derail progress. The Knight warns... wait until your heart and mind agree before charging ahead."

      "meaning_rev": "Good, economical, obliging, serviceable. Signifies also--but in certain positions and in the neighbourhood of other cards tending in such directions--opposition, jealousy, even deceit and infidelity.",
      "desc": "The Wands throughout this suit are always in leaf, as it is a suit of life and animation. Emotionally and otherwise, the Queen's personality corresponds to that of the King, but is more magnetic.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Queen of Wands radiates fierce magnetism and confidence... If you've drawn her upright, consider yourself quite fortunate. She brings energies of love, loyalty, and quiet power. This card whispers of a woman with a strong heart... warm, noble, and spirited. Themes of friendly devotion, business success, and attraction rise, connected to her leafy wand that pulses with life and emotional vibrancy.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "This is the Queen of Wands in reverse... and her smile may now hide deeper tensions. You're not especially lucky this time... the card's energy leans toward jealousy, opposition, and quiet betrayals. Her charm remains, but it flickers with questions. The leafy wand in her hand, once a symbol of connection and growth, now echoes with subtle manipulation and emotional turbulence.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "You were once inspired by someone with magnetic presence... their loyalty, strength, or warmth shaped your direction. Perhaps you too embodied these traits... giving much of yourself to those you trusted deeply.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, there's a need to step into your full confidence... to lead with heart and intuition. Someone around you sees you as both capable and kind... your energy is attracting the right people and opportunities.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "You're heading into a phase where your independence will shine... success is on the horizon if you remain grounded in your values. A supportive woman may enter your life... or you'll become one to others.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "A relationship once marked by closeness may have turned sour... possibly due to jealousy or hidden resentment. The warmth you gave wasn't always returned truthfully.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "You may be surrounded by subtle sabotage or emotional tension... a smiling face might not reflect true intention. Don't doubt your instincts... protect your energy and values now.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "The road ahead might test your trust... someone could act out of envy or self-interest. Stay wise and observant. This isn't a sign to retreat, but to lead with inner fire and clear boundaries.",
      "love_up_past": "There's a strong sense that your past relationships were shaped by a nurturing yet fiery presence... maybe you gave everything: loyalty, passion, support, but not everyone matched your depth. Someone may have adored you, even been inspired by your warmth, but they also feared your strength.",
      "love_up_present": "Right now, love revolves around confidence... whether it's yours or someone you're drawn to. A connection may be forming with someone radiant, independent, and emotionally mature. This isn't the time for passive romance... it's about mutual admiration and bold gestures.",

      "feelings_rev_past": "You may have experienced a period where you suppressed your emotions to keep others comfortable. A fear of being 'too much' may have stifled your joy or expression.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "There's emotional confusion now... are your feelings your own or reactions to someone else's energy? You might feel intense but restrained, like you're holding fire inside without release.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "Emotional burnout or distrust could lie ahead if you keep suppressing your truth. The Queen warns... don't let past wounds stop you from expressing your full range of feeling.",
      "actions_up_past": "In the past, you took bold and heartfelt actions that inspired others... your leadership came from instinct, not ego. Even your smallest gestures had impact.",

      "meaning_rev": "Good, but severe; austere, yet tolerant.",
      "desc": "The physical and emotional nature to which this card is attributed is dark, ardent, lithe, animated, impassioned, noble. The King uplifts a flowering wand, and wears, like his three correspondences in the remaining suits, what is called a cap of maintenance beneath his crown. He connects with the symbol of the lion, which is emblazoned on the back of his throne.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The King of Wands steps forward... and with him comes a surge of charisma, command, and unexpected luck. This is a fortunate pull for you. The card speaks of honesty, friendliness, and even hints at the arrival of an unexpected inheritance. Tied to nobility, fire, and a lion's spirit, this King stands tall in both heart and presence... his cap of maintenance reminds you that true power is carried, not worn.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The King of Wands appears reversed... a powerful sign but one tempered with caution. While you are not entirely unlucky, the energy around you is tense and volatile. Goodness still resides here... but it's cloaked beneath severity, austere judgments, and an unpredictable temper. The lion on his throne still roars... but now it growls more than it guides.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "Someone in your past carried the qualities of the King... bold, respected, and a strong influence in your direction. His honesty may have shaped a turning point in your life or inspired you to lead by integrity rather than fear.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Now is the time to command your space with confidence and kindness. Like the King, lead with both fire and fairness... and do not be surprised if unexpected opportunities, even wealth or legacy, quietly shift toward you.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "Ahead of you lies a chance to rise... to be seen as someone noble, trusted, and decisive. A path involving leadership or inheritance may soon unfold, but it will require a spirit as animated and grounded as this King himself.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "You may have been shaped by a rigid or overly disciplined influence... a person or situation that demanded too much too fast. The good may have been there, but its delivery may have left emotional scars.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "You might be stepping into a role where tolerance is tested... and your inner fire burns a little too hot or too cold. Pull back when needed. Assert yourself, yes... but avoid becoming the tyrant you fear.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "If you're not careful, your future may be led by an inflexible hand... whether yours or someone else's. The King reversed warns of noble intentions becoming oppressive. Let warmth temper your command, or risk leading alone.",
      "love_up_past": "There's a strong sense that a passionate, dominant figure from your past left a lasting impression on your love life... someone who swept in with warmth, loyalty, and bold intentions. That relationship taught you what it means to be adored but also what it means to be seen... truly seen. It may have been the first time you understood the power of charisma in romance.",
      "love_up_present": "Right now, there's a magnetic energy surrounding you... a pull toward someone who commands attention without trying. If you're in a relationship, your partner may be stepping into a more empowered role... or it could be you. There's mutual respect here... but only if pride doesn't overpower tenderness.",
      "love_up_future": "You are walking toward a connection that will be bold, honest, and deeply inspiring. A partner may enter your life who encourages leadership, not control... someone who ignites your passion and respects your independence. You won't settle for less than a soul that burns as brightly as yours.",
      "love_rev_past": "A controlling or overly stern partner may have influenced your emotional compass... perhaps you were drawn to intensity mistaking it for love. There was affection, yes, but it often came with rules... and now, you still carry the emotional consequences of that imbalance.",
      "love_rev_present": "Love right now may feel rigid... like one person is setting the tone and the other is simply adjusting. If you're single, your high standards might be pushing others away. If you're committed, the balance of power needs healing... or resentment will quietly grow.",
      "love_rev_future": "If you're not careful, love could become a battlefield of pride... one where affection gets buried under expectations. The reversed King warns you to soften your stance. Let passion breathe... let vulnerability exist.",
      "career_up_past": "In the past, you either embodied or were guided by someone who showed great entrepreneurial flair... someone decisive, respected, and wise. Their influence may have led to a moment of advancement or realization that leadership suited you more than subservience ever would.",
      "career_up_present": "Now is a prime time to step into a position of authority or confidence. You have what it takes to lead... whether it's a team, a project, or your own career path. The King's energy flows through you now... bold decisions will open doors.",
      "career_up_future": "The future brings recognition for your drive and your clear vision. If you continue on this path, you may be promoted or called upon to take charge of something greater. Expect others to look to you as a guide... and prepare to live up to that responsibility.",
      "career_rev_past": "You may have worked under someone who expected too much, too fast... or perhaps you were the one who tried to micromanage your own growth. There were lessons in patience, tolerance, and the cost of rigidity. You know now what kind of leader not to become.",
      "career_rev_present": "Your career path may feel stifling... even if you're in charge. There's a disconnect between control and flow. Are you trying too hard to shape things your way? Or is someone above you imposing limits? Something must give before burnout follows.",
      "career_rev_future": "Left unchecked, your ambition might lead to tyranny rather than triumph. The reversed King warns against future scenarios where your power could isolate you. Success will come... but only if you learn to delegate, to listen, and to inspire... not just command.",

      "finances_up_future": "Financial growth lies ahead, especially if you take command of your wealth like a leader with vision. Investments, savings, or leadership roles may yield great returns... as long as you stay grounded and wise in your dealings.",
      "finances_rev_past": "You may have been too strict or frugal with money in the past... or perhaps trusted someone who had good intentions but a cold delivery. Your lessons came not from lack, but from how control around finances affects freedom.",
      "finances_rev_present": "Your current approach to money may feel forced or overly rigid. You're doing well... but does it feel good? Loosening the reins slightly and balancing security with generosity could improve both your wealth and your peace of mind.",
      "finances_rev_future": "If you're not careful, an obsessive need to control your financial future could backfire. The reversed King warns of missed opportunities due to stubbornness. Flexibility... that's your future wealth's greatest ally.",
      "feelings_up_past": "You once felt secure and empowered in your emotions... even proud of how you carried yourself. Others may have looked up to you for your inner strength. This emotional maturity helped shape the confident person you're becoming.",

      "feelings_up_future": "Soon, you'll find yourself emotionally grounded... able to act on your feelings with confidence and integrity. You may become someone others come to for advice, strength, or calm in chaos. This future you leads with both heart and conviction.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "Your emotions may have once felt locked behind walls of duty or expectation. You were taught to appear strong... perhaps too strong. Feelings existed, but they were trimmed down to fit someone else's version of maturity.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "You may be experiencing a kind of emotional austerity... where things are 'fine' but not fully expressed. You're holding back. The reversed King nudges you to examine where discipline is stifling true emotional depth.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "Your future emotional state may be clouded by an unwillingness to soften. While being strong has served you, it might also isolate you down the line. The King reversed warns you not to mistake control for confidence. Let others in.",
      "actions_up_past": "You acted with dignity and leadership in the past, even if it wasn't always recognized. Whether it was for family, work, or your own growth, your behavior carried the traits of someone noble and fiercely committed.",
      "actions_up_present": "Now is the time to act with boldness and precision. Speak up. Take the lead. The King of Wands says you already possess what's needed... but now, you must step forward and own the moment. Others are watching.",
      "actions_up_future": "Future actions will define your legacy... you'll be placed in a position where integrity and fire must meet. If you lead with honor and courage, you'll not only succeed... you'll leave a mark others remember.",
      "actions_rev_past": "You may have once taken actions that, while well-intended, came off as too harsh or inflexible. The lesson wasn't in the mistake, but in the delivery. You now know how much tone can change everything.",
      "actions_rev_present": "Right now, your actions may be more controlling than commanding. Are you forcing outcomes? Take a breath. The King reversed asks you to lead with fairness, not fire. Your intentions are good... but the execution needs finesse.",
      "actions_rev_future": "Be mindful... future actions might be rooted more in ego than in truth. There's a risk of overreaching or becoming too authoritarian in your decisions. If you want lasting impact, act with presence, not just power."

This is one of the luckiest omens in the tarot, especially for those seeking bold beginnings and dynamic energy. It signals creation, enterprise, and origin... a raw power rising from within. A hand from the heavens offers the wand... the universe extending potential and daring the user to act.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Ace of Wands reversed dims the flame... Unluckier than its upright twin, this card reflects loss, ruin, and a fragile hope wrapped in clouded joy. The divine hand still reaches out but the wand feels heavy... inspiration may falter or burn too wildly before it can be shaped. The message here is caution... not all fire warms.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "There was a time when inspiration struck like lightning... a creative surge or opportunity lit up your path. That moment, even if short-lived, birthed a change in direction or desire. It was the spark that set future movements in motion.",

      "interpretation_rev_past": "An idea once held great promise but crumbled before it could bloom... perhaps from neglect, fear, or outside resistance. What should've been a beginning turned into a false start. Yet even failure taught you the cost of hesitation.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "There's a blockage around your spark... ambition may be tangled in doubt or decay. The wand slips through your fingers, not from lack of desire but from unclear purpose. You must first clear what clouds your inner fire before it can burn true again.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "A venture you expect to thrive may falter or twist into disappointment... unless you act with clarity and realism. A false light may lead you astray if you chase passion without foundation. Be wary of what seems promising but is poorly rooted.",
      "love_up_past": "A heat once sparked so quickly... It felt like fate placed you two together with the force of a match striking. The Ace of Wands suggests your past was marked by intense chemistry and bold moves in love. That moment still echoes, shaping your views on passion today.",
      "love_up_present": "A surge of desire flows through your love life now... If you're single, someone magnetic may soon appear and ignite a new romance.

      "love_up_future": "You're approaching a new romantic awakening... Whether it's a fresh connection or a deepening bond, passion will lead the way. This isn't a slow burn... it's a wildfire waiting for your spark. Be brave, open, and ready to feel again.",

      "career_up_present": "A professional spark is here... a new opportunity, idea, or challenge that lights you up inside. Say yes. Whether it's a job offer, creative project, or leadership role, it's time to claim your path with fire and focus.",
      "career_up_future": "A career breakthrough lies ahead... something bold, possibly unexpected, that invites you to step up. It's a chance to lead, invent, or rebuild. The key is to trust the fire within and not wait for permission.",

      "feelings_rev_past": "Emotions were once intense but chaotic... perhaps joy mixed with confusion or anger masked as drive. The past held a fire that lacked direction and left you drained.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "You may feel emotionally stifled or uncertain now... like your passion wants to burst free but can't find an outlet. It's time to pause and rediscover your emotional truth.",

      "actions_rev_present": "Hesitation or reckless action now could block your progress... step back, observe, and refocus. Action without clarity burns too fast to last.",
      "actions_rev_future": "Your future may demand a difficult choice... and inaction will no longer be safe. Avoidance or impulsiveness could lead to regret. Instead, plan, breathe, and leap with awareness."

      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Two of Wands enters with a strange duality... A powerful omen of ambition and command, yet laced with melancholy. You've drawn a card that walks between fortune, glory, and the unexpected sadness that follows success. Holding the globe like a titan, this figure surveys all, yet feels a void... suggesting a craving beyond material gain.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Two of Wands reversed flickers with unexpected tension... This isn't a lucky draw. It speaks of emotional unrest, creeping fears, and the eerie feeling of magic gone awry. Though the figure holds a world of potential, the reversal twists the image into one of shock, turmoil, and destabilized intent... a warning of enchantments that turn into confusion.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "You once stood in a place of authority and potential, looking out over your life like a commander surveying land. Yet with the riches came a deep unease... a sense that what you had gained came at an unseen cost.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "You're holding the world in your hands, but is it enough? This moment whispers of success that feels strangely hollow... like a goal achieved, yet unsatisfying. Now is the time to ask... what do you truly want?",
      "interpretation_up_future": "Soon you may find yourself blessed with recognition, wealth, or power... but don't be surprised if a quiet sadness follows. This card warns you not to chase victory blindly... make sure your path feeds your spirit too.",

      "interpretation_rev_future": "You may soon face a moment of wonder... but it won't be what it seems. Enchantment could lead to confusion or fear, especially if your plans aren't rooted in clarity. Prepare for unexpected currents... and trust your instincts when something feels off.",
      "love_up_past": "A powerful longing lingers here... like you once stood on the edge of a great emotional journey, yet held back. There may have been a chance for something lasting and beautiful, but pride or hesitation kept your heart sheltered. The memory of that choice still echoes through your present.",
      "love_up_present": "Something tells me your heart is standing at a crossroad... You may be in a relationship that feels secure, yet you dream of something more. This card suggests emotional safety paired with a restlessness... a yearning for passion, adventure, or a deeper soul bond.",
      "love_up_future": "Your love life is about to expand... but it won't be simple. A new connection or shift in dynamics may bring success, admiration, or even power as a couple. Yet beware... fulfillment in love must go beyond the surface, or you'll feel strangely alone despite being together.",
      "love_rev_past": "A past love once enchanted you, then left you uncertain and adrift. There may have been excitement, spontaneity, and wonder... but it turned too quickly into confusion or heartbreak. You may still carry the fear of being surprised again.",
      "love_rev_present": "There's emotional unrest stirring beneath your current connection. You might be unsure if the passion is fading or if your desires are no longer aligned. The reversed Two of Wands warns of illusions in love... something or someone may not be who they seem.",
      "love_rev_future": "A tempting romantic offer may soon appear... but tread carefully. It might seem magical at first, but will it bring clarity or chaos? Love may test your emotional balance, urging you to ask what you're really looking for before giving your heart away.",
      "career_up_past": "You once stood in a position of vision... perhaps you launched a bold idea or aimed high. That chapter taught you the thrill of ambition, but also the ache of isolation when no one truly understood your path.",

      "finances_up_past": "You've had moments of material gain in the past... yet they came with an odd emptiness. This card suggests that wealth or stability once arrived, but didn't resolve the deeper worries or longings tied to it.",
      "finances_up_present": "Your financial situation may be stable, even impressive from the outside... but are you fulfilled? This card hints that your current wealth is functional but disconnected from your passion. It's time to align your resources with your purpose.",
      "finances_up_future": "A financial breakthrough is within reach... perhaps through a bold investment, business venture, or recognition of your efforts. But true security will only come if you feel emotionally aligned with how you earn and spend.",

      "meaning_up": "It is a card of valour, for, on the surface, six are attacking one, who has, however, the vantage position. On the intellectual plane, it signifies discussion, wordy strife; in business--negotiations, war of trade, barter, competition. It is further a card of success, for the combatant is on the top and his enemies may be unable to reach him.",
      "meaning_rev": "Perplexity, embarrassments, anxiety. It is also a caution against indecision.",
      "desc": "A young man on a craggy eminence brandishing a staff; six other staves are raised towards him from below.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Seven of Wands arrives with fierce intensity... You've drawn a card of bravery and resistance, one that shows you're in a rare position of advantage despite overwhelming odds. Success is not handed to you... it's fought for. This card tells of wordy strife, cutthroat negotiations, and the courage to stand tall in the face of competition. The image of the lone figure on a crag defending against six foes mirrors your need to hold your ground and defend what you've earned.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Seven of Wands appears reversed... and with it, a tremor of doubt and inner conflict. This isn't a stroke of fortune... it's a signal that anxiety and indecision may be clouding your judgment. Perplexity and embarrassment haunt this card's meaning, and when paired with the image of the defender possibly faltering on rocky ground, it warns that hesitation might cost you your edge.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "You've been here before... pressed to defend your stance when no one else believed in it. Your past was not about fitting in but about resisting the easy path, and this card confirms that your previous stand against pressure laid the groundwork for present strength.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, you're holding the line against something or someone trying to pull you down. Whether in your work, beliefs, or personal boundaries... this card urges you not to back down. The pressure is intense, but your position is stronger than you think.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "A challenge is coming that will test your resolve... not through sheer force, but through persistence. This card foretells victory, but only if you hold your ground and trust the high place you stand on. Those beneath may try to shake you... but they won't reach you if you remain firm.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "Looking back, moments of self-doubt or missed decisions haunt your journey. You may have once hesitated at a crucial moment... the embarrassment or confusion left a mark. This card whispers that those old echoes of indecision still shape how you defend yourself today.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "You may be caught in an internal storm... questioning whether to act or retreat. Anxiety clouds the field, and your advantage is slipping through second-guessing. This card asks you to confront your hesitation head-on... because wavering now could mean losing your ground.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "Ahead lies a moment where clarity will blur and your footing may falter. The Seven of Wands reversed warns that indecision could leave you vulnerable... not because you're weak, but because you might hesitate too long. Steel yourself early, because standing firm starts in the mind before it shows in action.",
      "love_up_past": "There's a strong sense that you once had to defend a relationship that others didn't believe in... You might've fought hard to prove its worth, standing alone against judgment or outside pressures. Even if things didn't last, you earned respect for your devotion and for not backing down when love felt worth the battle.",
      "love_up_present": "Right now, your love life feels like a proving ground... You may be under pressure to justify your emotions or your commitment, either to yourself or others. The Seven of Wands suggests this struggle is not in vain. You're in a strong position... but you must stay grounded and guard what you've built.",
      "love_up_future": "You'll soon face tests in love that will require fierce loyalty and unshakable confidence.

      "love_rev_present": "You might be doubting the strength of your current relationship or feeling too tired to keep fighting for it... There's anxiety here, like you're unsure if it's still worth the energy. The Seven of Wands reversed says that indecision could widen the rift... unless you get clear on what you're really defending.",
      "love_rev_future": "If you let doubts linger too long, love may begin to feel like a losing battle. Future tension will test your ability to hold the line in matters of the heart... but wavering or delaying the emotional work might create distance that's hard to close later.",
      "career_up_past": "You've been in fierce competition before... and you came out on top, not because you were the most skilled, but because you were the most relentless. This card honors a time when you refused to back down professionally, even if others underestimated you.",

      "career_rev_past": "There was a time you let career opportunities slip through your fingers out of fear or confusion... This card reveals embarrassment or missed promotions that still sting. You may have held back when assertiveness was needed.",
      "career_rev_present": "You might be paralyzed by indecision or imposter syndrome right now... You know you have to act, but second-guessing is costing you momentum. The Seven of Wands reversed warns that if you don't assert your value, others may overtake your position.",
      "career_rev_future": "Challenges lie ahead, but hesitation could cost you more than just time... The reversed Seven of Wands suggests burnout or a crisis of confidence. If you don't stand up for your ideas, someone else will claim the spotlight you were meant to step into.",
      "finances_up_past": "You once fought hard to maintain financial control... There were moments of budgeting, negotiation, or even debt recovery where you refused to cave. This card honors your past resilience in money matters, even if it left you exhausted.",
      "finances_up_present": "You're likely in a secure financial place now, but it didn't come easily. You may feel like every cent is defended. The Seven of Wands shows that your financial decisions are being scrutinized... stay vigilant and strategic, because your strength is paying off.",
      "finances_up_future": "Financial challenges are coming... perhaps unexpected expenses or competitive ventures. But you're not powerless. This card foretells that standing your ground and planning defensively will lead to security, even if the road gets rough.",
      "finances_rev_past": "There were money mistakes... moments when you were overwhelmed, indecisive, or reactive instead of proactive. These past anxieties may still haunt how you deal with finances today. The card asks you to forgive yourself and learn from that indecision.",
      "finances_rev_present": "Right now, you may be unsure how to handle a financial decision... Hesitation could cost you more than making the wrong choice. The reversed Seven of Wands suggests that your uncertainty is opening the door to avoidable loss.",
      "finances_rev_future": "If you continue putting off important money moves or let fear guide your financial path, you may find yourself cornered. This card warns that defensive avoidance won't shield you forever... action, not perfection, is what will restore stability.",
      "feelings_up_past": "You once stood firm in your emotions, even when it was unpopular or misunderstood... This card reflects a time when you owned how you felt and didn't let others shake you, and that inner clarity has shaped your emotional strength today.",
      "feelings_up_present": "You are emotionally guarded right now... not because you're cold, but because you've had to protect your heart from criticism or doubt. The Seven of Wands says you're doing the right thing by holding firm, but make sure your defenses don't become walls.",
      "feelings_up_future": "Emotional tension is on the horizon... you may have to defend how you feel or even justify your vulnerability. But don't retreat. This card shows your inner world is valid and your courage to express it will bring powerful breakthroughs.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "You might've hidden or suppressed your feelings in the past out of fear of rejection... The reversed Seven of Wands reflects a time when your voice was quieted by anxiety. That avoidance shaped how you process emotions today.",

      "actions_up_future": "You'll be called to act in a decisive way soon, likely in a high-stakes or high-pressure situation. The Seven of Wands says you'll succeed if you trust your instincts and don't let the noise around you shake your focus.",
      "actions_rev_past": "There was a time when you froze instead of acting... maybe from fear, confusion, or lack of support. This hesitation left consequences that still linger. The reversed card urges you to reflect, not punish yourself, and use those lessons to act differently next time.",
      "actions_rev_present": "You may be hesitating right now... paralyzed between options or afraid of choosing wrong. The Seven of Wands reversed shows that inaction is the greater risk. This is not the time to retreat. One strong move can shift everything.",
      "actions_rev_future": "Soon, you'll be faced with a situation where indecision could cost you dearly. The reversal warns that waiting too long to act or trying to avoid confrontation will give power to others. Step forward with courage... even if you're not 100% ready."

This is an unlucky turn, warning of disputes at home, uneasy guilt, and tempers fraying in tight quarters. The wands, once swift and sure, now scatter... their course uncertain across an open, shifting landscape.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "Something in your past moved so quickly it barely gave you time to breathe... a decision made in haste, a connection that sparked instantly, or a chance that arrived and left just as fast. Yet it gave you momentum you still ride today.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "You're right in the middle of a rush... things are moving at high speed and there's little room for hesitation. This is a moment to act, not stall. News, travel, romance, or opportunity is already on its way and closing fast.",

      "finances_up_future": "Money stress won't vanish overnight, but you'll soon master it through sheer resilience. A delay in your financial goals may test your resolve, but you'll find a way through it by staying focused and not giving in to desperation.",
      "finances_rev_past": "Past financial chaos left more than empty pockets... it shook your sense of control. Perhaps you were blindsided, or someone failed you when you needed support. That instability still echoes in how you handle money now.",
      "finances_rev_present": "You may feel like no matter what you do, it's never enough... obstacles keep popping up. Whether it's unexpected bills or habits you can't shake, something's derailing your financial stability. You need to reset your patterns before things worsen.",
      "finances_rev_future": "If you're not careful, the future could bring a painful financial setback... one rooted not in fate, but in refusal to adapt. Don't keep patching a sinking ship... take serious action or brace for collapse.",
      "feelings_up_past": "In the past, your emotions were like soldiers in a trench... always alert, always bracing for the next emotional strike. You built strong walls around your heart, but they cost you softness and rest.",
      "feelings_up_present": "You're in emotional survival mode right now... cautious, hyper-aware, unwilling to drop your guard. But this defensive stance, while earned, may be cutting you off from deeper connections. Feelings are waiting to be heard behind those walls.",
      "feelings_up_future": "Your emotional resilience will be tested again... but this time, you'll be ready to face it without shutting down. Growth is coming, but only if you allow yourself to feel... not just fight.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "You've carried emotional scars that never fully healed... and instead of processing them, you buried them beneath toughness. The past weighs heavy, and old pain may be shaping your current reactions more than you know.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "You're emotionally exhausted... worn thin by constantly being 'the strong one.' It's time to acknowledge that vulnerability isn't a weakness... it's a release. Without letting go, you risk shutting down altogether.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "If you keep suppressing your feelings, they'll explode when you least expect it. The future will ask you to either finally process that internal chaos or let it consume your joy. Choose release before resistance becomes your identity.",

      "actions_rev_future": "If you continue on your current path, your future actions may spiral into avoidance or collapse. But if you pause now, reassess, and shift your energy, you'll rewrite a different ending... one that starts with surrendering the fight to win the war."

The chief meaning is oppression simply, but it is also fortune, gain, any kind of success, and then it is the oppression of these things. It is also a card of false-seeming, disguise, perfidy. The place which the figure is approaching may suffer from the rods that he carries. Success is stultified if the Nine of Swords follows, and if it is a question of a lawsuit, there will be certain loss.",
      "meaning_rev": "Contrarieties, difficulties, intrigues, and their analogies.",
      "desc": "A man oppressed by the weight of the ten staves which he is carrying.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Ten of Wands appears... and luck has a complicated face today. This card suggests oppression, burdens that follow even in fortune's wake, and the invisible weight of too much success. The man in the image is nearly crushed beneath his own victory... carrying all ten staves alone, he approaches a place that may suffer from the very weight he bears.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Ten of Wands in reverse has shown itself... and your luck may be strained. This card whispers of difficulties cloaked in confusion... contrarieties, intrigues, and subtle opposition. The figure remains burdened, but in this shadowed position, the load becomes even more entangled in deceptions, false leads, and tangled plans.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "You once shouldered more than you were meant to carry... perhaps because no one else stepped forward, or maybe because success demanded it. There was gain, yes, but it came wrapped in exhaustion... a chapter where responsibility weighed heavier than reward.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, you're stretched thin... trying to keep everything together while quietly breaking beneath the surface. What was once a triumph has become a chore, and it's time to ask if all these tasks, these duties, are truly yours to bear.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "A path lies ahead filled with ambition and achievement... but also with the crushing toll it demands. This card warns that without delegation, without balance, your success may become your prison. Choose carefully what burdens you agree to carry into tomorrow.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "There was a time when your plans twisted against you... riddled with unseen contradictions. You may have tried to push through, but the results were mired in setbacks, hidden agendas, or misaligned efforts. The load never felt right... because it never was.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "Now is a time of tangled expectations. You're likely caught in loops of confusion or feel like everything's working against itself. Progress feels hollow... nothing quite fits. This reversal urges you to unravel the mess before continuing.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "The future holds pressures you can't yet see... not from volume, but from contradiction. Plans may work against one another, allies might obscure intentions, and the road will feel heavier than it should. Prepare to question everything... and walk lighter when you can.",
      "love_up_past": "A heaviness lingers in your chest when you think of past love... the Ten of Wands says you carried the entire relationship on your shoulders. Perhaps you thought love meant sacrifice, or maybe your partner let you believe that. Either way, the joy slowly slipped away beneath the weight of effort and unmet reciprocity.",
      "love_up_present": "Right now, love feels more like responsibility than romance... you're likely giving too much, doing too much, and forgetting to simply feel. The Ten of Wands urges you to examine whether you're carrying burdens that aren't yours. Relationships should challenge you, not exhaust you.",
      "love_up_future": "The path ahead may involve committing deeply... perhaps too deeply. Future love may come with emotional weight or complex circumstances that demand more of you than you expect. Be cautious... passion is not always worth the price of peace.",
      "love_rev_past": "In past relationships, confusion and crossed intentions clouded everything... there were moments you tried to hold it together while everything crumbled behind your back. The Ten of Wands reversed says you were caught in love's contradictions, giving in ways that never aligned with what you truly wanted.",
      "love_rev_present": "Your heart may be wrapped in tension now... unclear emotions, unspoken burdens, and a lack of mutual clarity. You might be pretending things are okay while quietly unraveling. The Ten of Wands reversed urges you to untangle the mess before resentment takes root.",
      "love_rev_future": "Ahead lies a complicated love story... full of mixed messages and misaligned priorities. The reversed Ten warns that unless roles and expectations are cleared, the emotional burden will outweigh the passion. You'll need to choose honesty over illusion.",
      "career_up_past": "You once chased success with everything you had... but the rewards came with chains. The Ten of Wands says your past work life was marked by overachievement and hidden burnout. What seemed like opportunity became a cage of your own making.",
      "career_up_present": "Work feels endless right now... duties pile up, and every accomplishment seems to bring more weight. The Ten of Wands asks: are you working to live, or living to work? There's pride in your effort, but also danger in your silence about overwhelm.",
      "career_up_future": "Your ambition will lead to success... but with a cost. The future holds greater responsibility, higher stakes, and a danger of being the one everyone relies on. The Ten of Wands says you can carry it... but should you?",
      "career_rev_past": "Your professional past was riddled with contradictions... roles that didn't suit you, tasks that didn't align, and obligations you never agreed to. You may have worked hard... but progress felt like a puzzle with missing pieces.",
      "career_rev_present": "You're likely stuck in a role or project that doesn't make sense... too many cooks, too little clarity, and the burden is building. The reversed Ten urges you to pause and redefine your work boundaries before burnout locks you in.",
      "career_rev_future": "Your future work path may be unclear or self-defeating... you may push toward goals that work against one another or accept offers that cost too much. The Ten of Wands reversed says choose wisely... not all promotions are blessings.",
      "finances_up_past": "There was a time when wealth came... but not without a price. The Ten of Wands says your financial past involved gain followed by pressure... perhaps debts, obligations to family, or responsibilities no one warned you about.",
      "finances_up_present": "Your money situation feels like a burden right now... maybe you're earning well, but every cent is spoken for. The Ten of Wands tells you that financial gain isn't freedom unless it's managed carefully. You're carrying more than your share.",
      "finances_up_future": "Greater income is likely on its way... but so are the strings attached. The Ten of Wands hints at new responsibilities, hidden fees, or pressure to support others. If you're not cautious, your money may own you instead of the other way around.",
      "finances_rev_past": "Money matters from the past were full of complications... miscommunications about loans, unclear investments, or promises you wish you hadn't made. The reversed Ten says your finances were once a tangle that took energy without giving peace.",
      "finances_rev_present": "Now, your financial decisions may feel like a trap... you're juggling too many plans, trying too many methods, or listening to too many voices. The Ten of Wands reversed urges simplification. Cut out the noise before it drains you completely.",
      "finances_rev_future": "Your future financial path holds hidden traps... not from lack, but from being tied to goals that conflict. You may try to save and spend, grow and give, all at once. The reversed Ten warns that without clear direction, you'll lose more than money.",
      "feelings_up_past": "You used to carry emotions in silence... always composed, always the strong one. The Ten of Wands says your past was a maze of internal pressure, hiding your exhaustion from everyone. You survived... but at what cost to your peace?",
      "feelings_up_present": "Emotionally, you're heavy right now... overwhelmed but unwilling to show it. The Ten of Wands reflects an inner world full of stress, duty, and repressed needs. You're due for emotional release... or else you'll break in silence.",
      "feelings_up_future": "You may soon find yourself in a place where feelings build faster than you can process. The Ten of Wands says your future emotional state could become too full... especially if you keep absorbing others' pain along with your own.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "You once felt all the wrong things at all the wrong times... and no one seemed to notice. The reversed Ten reflects a past emotional chaos... trying to stay composed when inside everything contradicted itself.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "Your emotions are tangled now... you can't tell if what you feel is yours, or something you've absorbed from others. The Ten of Wands reversed warns that you're not being honest about what you're really carrying inside.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "Emotional confusion may follow you into the future if you don't pause soon. The reversed Ten warns of suppressed feelings erupting unexpectedly... feelings that contradict your choices and blur your direction.",
      "actions_up_past": "You once did everything... for everyone. The Ten of Wands shows past actions driven by duty, pressure, and the fear of letting people down. You got things done... but the cost was always too high.",
      "actions_up_present": "You're doing too much right now... taking on tasks to prove something, or to keep control. The Ten of Wands urges you to delegate and trust. You don't need to carry it all to be worthy.",
      "actions_up_future": "Soon, you'll face choices that tempt you to take on more than you should. The Ten of Wands says you can do it all... but should you? Let wisdom, not ego, decide your actions moving forward.",
      "actions_rev_past": "Your past actions often worked against you... even when well-intended. The reversed Ten reflects efforts that led to confusion, or obligations accepted without clarity. You moved, but progress felt hollow.",
      "actions_rev_present": "Your current efforts are scattered... you're trying too many things, and none feel aligned. The reversed Ten says you're busy but not effective. It's time to re-center and act with precision, not panic.",
      "actions_rev_future": "The future holds a warning... you're at risk of committing to things that conflict with your values or your energy. The Ten of Wands reversed whispers: pause before you say yes to more. What you agree to will shape your path."

You're quite lucky to receive this card upright, as it often speaks of fresh emotional beginnings, messages of affection, and moments of heartfelt clarity. It suggests news or a message approaching, possibly from a gentle or studious youth, and it's tied to a period of reflection and emotional sincerity... The imagery of the fish emerging from the cup hints at ideas and emotions surfacing when least expected, a moment of inner creativity meeting the outside world.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "Drawn in reverse, the Page of Cups stirs up a quiet sense of caution... This is a less fortunate omen, often suggesting emotional confusion, false charm, or illusions that cloud judgment. It reveals hidden tendencies such as seduction, deception, and artifice... The fish rising from the cup now feels suspicious, as if the dreams you chase might be playing tricks or masking deeper truths.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "A time in your past held quiet emotional awakenings... You may have received unexpected news, perhaps from someone younger or more idealistic, that shaped your path. This was a period of emotional curiosity where you were learning to trust your instincts, even if they didn't fully make sense yet.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, there's a message of the heart trying to reach you... It could arrive through someone sweet, reflective, or even dreamy in nature.

      "interpretation_up_future": "A fresh wave of emotion awaits you ahead... It may begin with a simple text, a soft gesture, or a moment of inner realization. This card hints at romantic surprises or intuitive ideas that bloom unexpectedly... The Page of Cups asks you to be ready to receive what the world gently offers next.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "There was a time when charm disguised deeper motives... Perhaps someone's sweet demeanor masked manipulation, or your own feelings led you down a naive path. In hindsight, it's clear now that not every invitation was pure or every emotion honest.",

That moment shaped your emotional core, even if it didn't last forever.",

The Page of Cups upright foretells a new emotional beginning... Be ready to respond with authenticity and gentleness.",

      "finances_rev_past": "You may have once made a financial decision based on hope rather than logic... The Page of Cups reversed warns of poor judgment or falling for something too good to be true. That misstep was likely tied to emotional impulse or charm that masked the risks.",

      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Knight of Cups reversed rides under a veiled sky... This card leans toward misfortune, revealing trickery, swindling, and fraud. What was once an offer of romance or creativity now reeks of subtle manipulation. The winged helmet once symbolizing imagination now whispers of illusions... a dreamer haunted by his own shadows, projecting fantasy as truth.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "In the past, this Knight brought someone or something into your life that felt divinely timed... a proposal, a creative pursuit, or even a person who stirred your emotions gently. Reflect on who arrived during that time... they came with an open heart, even if it didn't last.",

You're craving something real, but illusions or mismatched expectations may be blurring the truth. Look inward... is it love, or the idea of love, that you're holding onto?",
      "love_rev_future": "Love ahead may tempt you with surface-level promises... but lack the substance to truly satisfy. Be cautious of relationships that offer comfort without emotional truth. Freedom may lie in letting go of what only looks good, so your heart can find what genuinely fulfills.",

      "actions_rev_present": "You may be acting out of habit rather than intention... making decisions that seem fine but don't fully resonate with who you are. It's time to pause and realign your actions with your emotional truth.",
      "actions_rev_future": "If you move forward without reflection, you may repeat old patterns of chasing what doesn't fulfill. The future asks for intentional action... rooted in truth, not impulse. That's where real peace begins."

It signifies contentment, the perfection of emotional bonds, and peaceful love. You're looking at a rare moment of complete heart satisfaction... Like the rainbow arching over the joyful family in the scene, there's a sense of divine alignment between your desires and your reality.",

This is an unfortunate draw, often revealing false contentment, hidden unrest, or emotional betrayal. The appearance of the happy family now feels like a mask... A peaceful exterior might be hiding indignation or volatility beneath.",

It signals an energy of study, application, and reflection... an ideal time for investing in growth. Like the youthful figure fixated on the coin suspended before him, you may find yourself entering a phase where focus and potential align in meaningful ways.",

It speaks of prodigality, dissipation, and a taste for luxury that may not be sustainable. The page's dreamy gaze becomes distraction... too absorbed in desires to notice what's slipping away around them.",

      "love_up_past": "There's a quiet ache that hints you once approached love with the wide eyes of hope... In the past, your heart may have been devoted with pure intentions, but still learning how to handle its worth. This card reflects a time where you were eager to understand love, often giving more than you received, seeing relationships as lessons rather than guarantees.",
      "love_up_present": "Something tells me you're entering a phase of romantic growth... not fireworks, but deeper understanding. If you're single, someone may catch your attention with a quiet presence and shared values. If you're attached, now is the time to reinvest... study your partner like a beautiful text you've yet to fully understand.",

With idleness, discouragement, and inertia hanging in the air, this knight no longer rides but simply exists.

      "career_rev_past": "You may have spent time coasting or letting opportunities pass you by out of fear or fatigue. The reversed Knight points to a phase of career inertia where stability may have bred complacency or stagnation.",
      "career_rev_present": "Work may feel dull or repetitive right now, and motivation might be slipping through your fingers. The reversed Knight warns that passivity could cost you growth if you don't choose to reengage with purpose soon.",
      "career_rev_future": "If you continue at your current pace without reflection, a sense of stuckness or wasted potential may weigh heavy in your future career. It's time to reignite your drive and stop hiding behind 'just getting by.'",
      "finances_up_past": "Your financial choices in the past were likely conservative and careful... built on slow accumulation rather than risk. The Knight suggests you built your stability one small decision at a time, and now you're seeing the long-term benefit.",

      "finances_rev_past": "A pattern of neglect or avoidance may have harmed your financial stability in the past. The reversed Knight hints at money wasted through inaction, laziness, or letting things slip through the cracks.",

      "actions_up_past": "Your past actions were marked by dedication and follow-through. Even if progress was slow, you kept going when others gave up... and that quiet persistence has shaped your life more than you realize.",
      "actions_up_present": "This is a time to focus on consistency over excitement. Show up, stay present, and do the work. The Knight of Pentacles reminds you that reliability is an action, and it's what sets you apart right now.",
      "actions_up_future": "Future success hinges on slow, methodical actions taken daily. Big leaps won't serve you as much as small, intentional steps. Keep moving, even if it feels like nothing is changing yet.",
      "actions_rev_past": "Your past inaction or hesitation may have cost you momentum. This Knight reversed reflects a time when you let things drift instead of pushing forward... and now you're seeing the effect.",
      "actions_rev_present": "You may be avoiding action or stuck in routines that no longer serve you. The reversed Knight urges you to break the loop... your energy is being wasted by doing nothing meaningful.",
      "actions_rev_future": "If you don't disrupt the current inertia, the future may be filled with regret for what you didn't do. The Knight warns that comfort can become a trap if you never choose something bolder."

Her energy speaks of opulence, security, and magnificence... She stares into her pentacle as if it were a world of its own, hinting that your material and emotional needs are deeply intertwined and nurtured by care.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Queen of Pentacles appears reversed, and her warmth dims into caution... This is an unfortunate sign, suggesting mistrust, fear, and dark suspicion. Her noble soul twists into guarded suspense... The image of her intense gaze now speaks more of watching than nurturing, as if the very symbol she holds is a source of dread rather than comfort.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "In the past, you were the provider... generous with time, money, or love. Others may have leaned on your warmth, yet it's possible you never asked for anything in return. You built stability from devotion, not demand.",

      "interpretation_rev_past": "A sense of fear or mistrust once shaped your way of giving. Maybe someone took advantage, or perhaps you closed yourself off in response. You were protective... not selfish, but careful from wounds not yet healed.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "You may be doubting someone's intentions... or your own value. Suspicion clouds your judgment, making you see danger in comfort. Don't let past betrayals warp the generous spirit that still lives within you.",

      "love_up_past": "There's a deep sense of stability radiating from your past relationships... You may have been the nurturer, the one who provided comfort, consistency, and warmth. This card reflects a time when love felt like a safe home rather than a wildfire. If things didn't last, it wasn't due to lack of devotion but perhaps because others weren't ready to meet you with the same depth.",
      "love_up_present": "Right now, you may be offering someone a sanctuary... or yearning for a partner who sees your value beyond surface charms. The Queen's energy brings loyal, earthy affection... If you're single, someone grounded and generous could be drawing near. If you're partnered, this card asks you to nurture your bond like a precious garden.",
      "love_up_future": "Soon, love will arrive or evolve with a comforting weight. It won't sweep you off your feet but rather offer a sense of belonging. Expect deep loyalty, mutual care, and someone who sees your worth not in words but through unwavering presence.",

      "feelings_up_present": "You're emotionally mature and others may feel soothed by your presence. You might be feeling proud of your stability, or recognizing the emotional labor you've shouldered. It's time to make space for your own inner nourishment too.",
      "feelings_up_future": "Peaceful confidence will soon replace emotional chaos. You're stepping into a phase where your feelings don't overpower you... they guide you. Your emotional state will feel like fertile soil... steady, rooted, and alive.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "You may have suppressed your emotions in the past, hiding them under a calm exterior. Fear of being hurt or mistrusted by those close to you could've made you emotionally distant, even when you longed for connection.",

      "actions_rev_past": "You may have acted out of fear or mistrust in the past... maybe holding back when you should've stepped forward, or giving too much where it wasn't earned. This bred frustration and hesitation in future steps.",
      "actions_rev_present": "You might be acting defensively or second-guessing yourself. Avoid decisions made from suspicion alone. This is a moment to slow down, reassess your motives, and rebuild your trust in your own judgment.",
      "actions_rev_future": "If future choices are shaped by fear, you may end up missing valuable opportunities. There's a quiet warning here... trust the process, act with intention, and don't let imagined threats hold you back."

      "meaning_rev": "Vice, weakness, ugliness, perversity, corruption, peril.",
      "desc": "The figure calls for no special description the face is rather dark, suggesting also courage, but somewhat lethargic in tendency. The bull's head should be noted as a recurrent symbol on the throne. The sign of this suit is represented throughout as engraved or blazoned with the pentagram, typifying the correspondence of the four elements in human nature and that by which they may be governed. In many old Tarot packs this suit stood for current coin, money, deniers. I have not invented the substitution of pentacles and I have no special cause to sustain in respect of the alternative. But the consensus of divinatory meanings is on the side of some change, because the cards do not happen to deal especially with questions of money.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The King of Pentacles... This is a fortunate draw, signaling grounded success and mastery of material life. It speaks of valor, practical intelligence, and the quiet confidence of someone who's already won the game of stability. The dark, steady face of the king reflects a deep patience... his throne adorned with bulls and pentagrams tells of dominion over earth's riches and elemental balance.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The King of Pentacles appears reversed... and with it, an uneasy omen. This card leans toward vice, corruption, and the dangers of pride twisted into arrogance. The bull on his throne once symbolized strength... now it hints at stubborn indulgence, a mind dulled by comfort, and a warning that not all wealth comes clean.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "In your past lies a time of calculated efforts and wise choices... You once moved with discipline, stacking gains like bricks, slowly building something others only dreamed of. The King reflects someone who may have guided or supported you... or perhaps you stepped into this power yourself, even if you didn't fully realize it then.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, you stand on solid ground... or you're closer than you think. This is a moment for calm leadership, financial growth, and practical decisions. There's no need to rush... you already carry the tools. Stability surrounds you... but only if you trust your own structure.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "The future calls you to take command of your resources... and your reputation. The King suggests that you will rise to a position of power if you stay grounded. Your success won't come from force... but from consistency, integrity, and the wisdom to know when to hold your hand close.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "There was a time when materialism may have taken hold... or a person of influence manipulated your trust. The reversed King warns of a history where values were compromised for gain, and what was built may have had cracks from the start.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "You may be surrounded by wealth... but is it worth the weight? Corruption, greed, or an unwillingness to adapt could be blocking growth. The reversed King calls out comfort zones and lazy crowns... It's time to confront what's rotting beneath the gold.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "Unless you redirect your energy, the path ahead may lead to moral compromise or shallow victories. The reversed King warns that success without virtue corrodes from within... You'll be asked to choose between power and purpose. The right choice may cost you... but it'll save your soul.",
      "love_up_past": "There's a strong sense that you once loved with purpose and protection... Someone in the past offered you stability, a partner who provided, supported, and planned for the future. The King of Pentacles in this position points to a relationship built on mutual respect and shared material goals... yet one that may have lacked emotional spontaneity. If you were the one holding it all together, it may have cost you more than others realized.",
      "love_up_present": "A deep-rooted energy surrounds your love life now... It's grounded, committed, and built to last. You or your partner may be playing the provider role, showing love through actions and security rather than words. The King says you're not chasing wild romance right now... you're nurturing a steady flame. If single, you're attracting someone mature, established, and loyal.",
      "love_up_future": "There's a sense that a future relationship will be anchored in trust and shared ambition... The King suggests you'll either become a dependable partner yourself or attract someone with serious intentions. Think slow courtship, long-term planning, and a love that matures like fine wine... practical, but deeply fulfilling.",
      "love_rev_past": "There was a time when love felt more like a transaction than a connection... A past partner may have used their power or money to control you, or perhaps emotional needs were overlooked in favor of stability. The reversed King warns that safety came at the cost of warmth... and you may still carry the weight of that imbalance.",
      "love_rev_present": "Right now, your love life may be out of sync... There could be possessiveness, neglect, or an over-focus on material status. The reversed King hints that one person may be trying to dominate the relationship or withhold affection as a form of control. It's time to ask: is this partnership truly nourishing you?",
      "love_rev_future": "If you're not careful, the future may bring a relationship that looks good on paper but leaves your heart hollow... The reversed King warns of emotionally unavailable lovers, transactional love, or commitments made for the wrong reasons. Real intimacy can't be bought... you'll have to demand more or walk away.",
      "career_up_past": "A past period in your career was marked by growth through discipline... You took your role seriously, earned the respect of others, and built something lasting. The King suggests a time when your skills were matched with opportunity... even if your passion was secondary, your reputation thrived.",
      "career_up_present": "You are in a powerful position... or you're stepping into one. The King of Pentacles says your career is demanding leadership, responsibility, and practical brilliance. Others look to you now... not just for results, but for steadiness. Stay focused, because you're setting the tone for your legacy.",
      "career_up_future": "Soon, you may be offered a role that puts you in control... This could be a managerial position, a business of your own, or a role that aligns prestige with purpose. The King doesn't hand out success freely... but if you stay grounded, you'll lead others with confidence and clarity.",
      "career_rev_past": "There may have been a period when your career path felt soulless... Perhaps you were working under someone who misused power, or maybe you were chasing promotions at the expense of peace. The reversed King reflects burnout, missed ethics, or feeling like a cog in someone else's machine.",
      "career_rev_present": "Right now, your work may feel stagnant or corrupt... The reversed King warns that ambition has tipped into greed or that you're compromising too much for material rewards. Toxic leadership, poor boundaries, or a fear of taking risks could be holding you back from better opportunities.",
      "career_rev_future": "If you don't course-correct, you could find yourself stuck in a role that drains you... Prestige might come, but at the cost of joy or integrity. The reversed King warns that success without alignment leads to discontent. Choose growth over gold... or risk becoming what you once resented.",
      "finances_up_past": "You once managed your resources with wisdom... Past decisions laid a foundation of financial stability. The King suggests that you took control, made steady gains, or were mentored by someone skilled in money matters. You may still benefit from choices made during this prosperous time.",
      "finances_up_present": "This is a good time for financial growth... not through luck, but through smart management. The King reflects mature money energy: budgeting, investing, building wealth slowly and surely. If you're disciplined now, you're setting yourself up for lasting abundance.",
      "finances_up_future": "The path ahead shows potential for long-term financial security... if you remain methodical and resist shortcuts. The King of Pentacles hints at owning property, expanding income streams, or becoming someone others seek out for financial guidance. Keep building... you're almost there.",
      "finances_rev_past": "There was a time when money was misused or poorly managed... A lack of discipline or an unhealthy attachment to wealth may have caused setbacks. The reversed King points to past greed, dependency on others, or ignoring financial red flags. Recovery may still be part of your journey.",
      "finances_rev_present": "Your current financial picture may seem stable on the surface... but there are cracks beneath. The reversed King warns of careless spending, over-investment in appearances, or dependence on unstable sources. It's time to regain control before things spiral further.",
      "finances_rev_future": "Without a shift in mindset, your financial future could be compromised by poor planning or toxic habits... The reversed King warns of getting rich quick schemes, irresponsible lending, or decisions driven by ego. Simplicity and humility will be your safest currency.",
      "feelings_up_past": "In the past, your emotional state was calm, measured, and perhaps a little distant... You may have buried deep feelings under layers of logic and duty. The King suggests emotional maturity... but also a tendency to keep others at arm's length. You were steady, but were you fulfilled?",
      "feelings_up_present": "Right now, your emotions are under control... maybe too much so. You're channeling your feelings into structure, goals, and practical action. The King of Pentacles speaks of emotional resilience, but also emotional restraint. You're holding it together well... but don't forget to feel, too.",
      "feelings_up_future": "The future holds a more integrated emotional state... One where you'll feel both secure and expressive. The King suggests you'll know exactly how to manage your feelings without suppressing them. Others will look to you as a calm, wise presence... grounded in experience and quiet confidence.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "There was a time when your emotions were buried under layers of numbness or control... You may have avoided vulnerability or used work to dodge deeper feelings. The reversed King reflects suppressed grief, detachment, or the legacy of being emotionally neglected.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "You might feel cut off from your own emotions... like you're functioning, but not feeling. The reversed King urges you to reconnect with what's beneath the surface. Numbness isn't strength... and holding back too much could be eroding your well-being.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "If you don't start acknowledging your emotions, the future may feel emotionally dry... The reversed King warns of burnout, loneliness, or regret over what was never expressed. It's not too late to break the pattern. You just need to give yourself permission to be human again.",
      "actions_up_past": "In the past, your actions were methodical and disciplined... You moved with strategy, not impulse. The King reflects strong foundations, wise planning, and decisions that prioritized long-term success over short-term thrills. It wasn't flashy, but it worked.",
      "actions_up_present": "You're currently being called to act with maturity, patience, and precision... The King wants you to lead by example, make grounded choices, and avoid emotional reactivity. Your current actions are setting a precedent... so move as if the world is watching.",
      "actions_up_future": "Soon, you'll have the chance to step into a role of responsibility... The King says your future actions should reflect leadership and integrity. Take slow, confident steps... and others will follow. You're building something real, not just for yourself, but for those who come after you.",
      "actions_rev_past": "There was a time when your actions were misaligned with your values... Perhaps you overstepped, procrastinated, or allowed fear to make choices for you. The reversed King suggests a misuse of power or a failure to act when it truly mattered.",
      "actions_rev_present": "Right now, you may be acting out of insecurity or control... The reversed King warns of behavior rooted in fear, stubbornness, or avoidance. You may appear composed... but internally, you're resisting change. It's time to choose action over ego.",
      "actions_rev_future": "If left unchecked, your future actions could be overly rigid or self-serving... The reversed King warns of leadership without empathy or choices made from pride. You'll be tested... not just on what you do, but why you do it. Integrity will matter more than outcomes."

This is a lucky card, charged with perfect contentment, ecstasy, and swift opportunities. It marks the threshold of material bliss... a new seed of gold placed in your path. The hand emerging from the cloud suggests unseen forces blessing your earthly ambitions.",

It speaks of the evil side of wealth, poor judgment, and misused opportunity. While it still hums with prosperity, the card asks... is this truly a blessing, or a curse in disguise? The hand still holds the pentacle, but the gesture feels heavier now... almost possessive.",

      "love_up_future": "A new romance is forming or will soon appear that brings both emotional and material richness. This is someone who wants to grow with you, invest in you, and support your long-term vision. The kind of love that builds a home, not just a moment.",
      "love_rev_past": "In love, you may have accepted something for its comfort or status, not realizing how hollow it would feel. The relationship may have been rooted in practicality... but it lacked emotional depth, leaving a quiet emptiness in its wake.",

      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Two of Pentacles dances into your spread like a juggler on a tightrope... If this is your card, you're neither cursed nor especially lucky but definitely being tested. It signals moments of gaiety, playful distractions, and sudden written news. The figure dancing with two coins looped in an endless 8 which reflects a cycle you're being asked to balance, no matter the chaos beneath your feet.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "The Two of Pentacles reversed wobbles in with an uneasy grin... This is not your luckiest draw. What seems like joy may be forced, and there's a creeping pressure to keep up appearances. Expect messages, possibly literal handwriting or letters, that highlight what you're trying too hard to fake. That twisted cord of infinity now feels more like a bind than a rhythm.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "In the past, you danced on shifting ground, juggling competing priorities while putting on a brave face... You adapted well, even if the messages you received stirred more questions than clarity.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, you're walking the line between harmony and chaos... something lighthearted is masking deeper turbulence. A letter, message, or surprising update may soon shift your rhythm.",

I sense the energy of someone who kept many lovers or flirtations spinning like plates, never letting any one of them fall. You might've danced between two hearts, enjoying the thrill but avoiding deeper commitment. The fun was real, but it never stood still long enough to become something lasting.",
      "love_up_present": "Right now, your heart may be juggling emotions... two people, two choices, or the tension between self-love and romantic love. You're trying to keep balance while staying lighthearted, but the deeper you avoid grounding the connection, the more likely someone will feel neglected. The truth might come through a message or conversation you've been putting off.",

Something important is coming perhaps an unexpected message that'll force you to drop one coin and catch another. Don't ignore the signs of imbalance.",
      "love_rev_past": "Your romantic past holds the echo of forced smiles... You may have pretended things were fine when inside, you were exhausted from pretending. The joy in the relationship was sometimes more performance than passion. Old letters, texts, or even memories of how much effort it took to act 'happy' might still linger.",
      "love_rev_present": "Right now, there's a growing weariness in your romantic energy... If you're in a relationship, you may be going through the motions, smiling for others while inside you're drained. If single, you could be forcing yourself into situations that no longer feel genuine. A message, possibly even from yourself, might shake things loose soon.",
      "love_rev_future": "Ahead, a reckoning comes in your love life... One too many fake laughs or rehearsed affections may trigger a collapse. Something written, like a breakup text or an emotional letter, may bring the curtain down. The heart can't keep dancing to music it doesn't feel.",
      "career_up_past": "In your past work life, multitasking ruled the day... You handled multiple responsibilities or even jobs, juggling with grace. Though it was chaotic, your energy impressed others. You likely learned how to adapt quickly... even when new opportunities dropped in out of nowhere.",
      "career_up_present": "Work feels like a constant spin... You're keeping deadlines, side hustles, and maybe even personal projects all in the air. It's admirable, but don't let the act distract from deeper goals. A new message, an offer, opportunity, or even challenge could tip the balance.",
      "career_up_future": "Soon, your ability to juggle tasks will be tested in ways that require even more agility... You might receive an offer through email or writing that demands a sudden shift. Don't panic... if you stay light on your feet, you'll land exactly where you need to be.",
      "career_rev_past": "Your past work efforts may have looked productive from the outside... but inside, you were forcing energy you didn't have. You pushed yourself to maintain a cheerful appearance even when the job left you drained. Maybe you clung to a routine because it looked 'right' rather than felt right.",
      "career_rev_present": "Right now, work might feel like a performance... You're smiling through burnout, nodding in meetings while mentally elsewhere. A task, letter, or contract might soon expose what's been hidden. Take it seriously... the cost of pretending is growing.",
      "career_rev_future": "The future of your career brings a warning... If you continue pushing for appearances over authenticity, something will give. You may receive communication, perhaps even a layoff notice or critique, that forces a shift. Start preparing now to pivot with truth, not pressure.",
      "finances_up_past": "You've danced a delicate financial dance before... balancing bills, side gigs, and perhaps even risks. Though stressful at times, you always managed to land on your feet. The past shows resilience... but also a pattern of temporary fixes.",
      "finances_up_present": "Your money situation now feels fluid but fragile... You're likely handling more than one income stream or dealing with fluctuating payments. Keep track of small updates... emails or invoices could alter the picture suddenly. Stay alert to avoid missteps.",
      "finances_up_future": "In the near future, a message about money, possibly a payment or an opportunity will require your flexibility... Will you juggle wisely or let it slip through? Your balance now determines whether you soar or sink.",
      "finances_rev_past": "In the past, you may have covered up financial strain with smiles... perhaps pretending things were fine when they weren't. Overspending to keep up appearances or relying on superficial solutions shows up here. Old receipts or bank statements may haunt you still.",
      "finances_rev_present": "Right now, your financial situation may be more performance than progress... There's pressure to appear stable while inside, you're scrambling. Watch for a letter or bank update that disrupts your rhythm... it's better to face the truth now than be blindsided later.",
      "finances_rev_future": "Ahead, a financial shake-up could expose what's been hidden... The danger lies not in the loss itself, but in your refusal to acknowledge it. A message or transaction might force the act to end. Start adjusting now.",
      "feelings_up_past": "Emotionally, your past was full of motion and distraction... You kept things playful, perhaps even upbeat, to avoid deeper dives into your feelings. Though there was joy, something was always left unspoken.",

      "feelings_rev_future": "Ahead, the cost of emotional denial grows heavier... A trigger may come in writing like a text, a letter, or even your own words that will crack the mask. Let it. Feelings demand truth to heal.",
      "actions_up_past": "You once moved with purpose, even if chaotic... Your actions kept many things afloat, showing adaptability and drive. It was a dance of control even in messiness, and it brought you valuable lessons.",
      "actions_up_present": "Right now, your moves are fast and reactive... Juggling projects, people, or feelings with sharp focus. But don't let the performance distract you from purpose. A sudden message might guide your next act.",
      "actions_up_future": "Your next actions must be nimble... Something is coming that will require you to shift focus quickly. Be ready to adapt when the message arrives. Movement will be your ally, not resistance.",
      "actions_rev_past": "Your past actions were not always honest to yourself... You may have pushed forward with things you didn't enjoy, faking it just to keep pace. The energy feels exhausted but unresolved.",
      "actions_rev_present": "Currently, your actions feel like routines you're no longer invested in... You're doing things out of obligation or image. Soon, something written, maybe a message or instruction, may call for honest reevaluation.",
      "actions_rev_future": "If you continue forcing action without real desire, the future brings a stumble... A mistake, or a response to your actions, will reflect the cost of pretending. When the message comes, take it seriously and pivot fast."

      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Five of Swords appears... and with it comes a sharp chill in the air. This is not a fortunate draw. It echoes with the sting of degradation, dishonour, and loss. The imagery speaks volumes... a lone victor clutching swords, while others retreat in defeat... a battlefield of pride, broken trust, and harsh consequences.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "Reversed, the Five of Swords offers no escape from its cutting edge... this is an unlucky card, whispering of burial, obsequies, and silent aftermaths. The man remains dominant, yet his victory feels hollow... swords scattered like remnants of failed peace. What has been taken may never be returned.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "In the past, you've experienced the bite of betrayal or personal loss... perhaps a conflict where the cost was too high. This card suggests you won... but at what price? The emotional aftermath lingers, even now.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, you may be facing a no-win situation... someone seeks to dominate, or perhaps it's you trying too hard to come out on top. Beware of ego, manipulation, and the fallout of forcing your will on others.",
      "interpretation_up_future": "If you're not careful, future conflicts will leave a wake of isolation behind you. Choose your battles wisely... for victory without integrity leads to emptiness. Consider what you're willing to sacrifice before stepping forward.",
      "interpretation_rev_past": "A recent loss may have been buried rather than dealt with... you or someone else swept the conflict aside, pretending it didn't cut deep. The wound, though hidden, still pulses beneath the surface.",
      "interpretation_rev_present": "Now is a moment of uneasy peace... you've turned away from conflict, or someone has conceded. But there's no real closure. This isn't healing... it's just silence. Pay attention to what remains unresolved.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "Coming days bring quiet endings... a retreat or loss may be inevitable, but not dramatic. Let go of what no longer serves you with grace, not bitterness. Honor the fallen swords without picking them back up.",
      "love_up_past": "A sense of deep tension lingers in your love history... like a fight that ended in words unspoken or a separation that still echoes. This card suggests a past romantic battle where someone walked away bruised... possibly you. You may have won the argument but lost the connection.",
      "love_up_present": "A difficult confrontation or emotional standoff may be playing out now... one person wants control, the other just wants peace. If you're in a relationship, pride may be driving a wedge between you. If you're single, you may be carrying old love wounds that make trusting again hard.",
      "love_up_future": "The future holds potential for love... but not without a choice. Will you pursue connection at the cost of your values, or will you walk away from someone whose energy drains yours? Heartbreak is avoidable, but only if you learn from the past and choose honesty over winning.",
      "love_rev_past": "You tried to move on from an old heartbreak, but it never truly left you... a relationship ended with silence or ghosting, and closure never came. The emotional burial didn't heal... it numbed. There's still a part of you that wonders what could've been.",
      "love_rev_present": "Something feels unresolved in your current love life... even if things seem calm, there's an emotional coldness or avoidance creeping in. This isn't peace... it's surrender. You or your partner may be afraid to stir up conflict again, but healing requires truth.",
      "love_rev_future": "You may soon leave behind a toxic love dynamic... not with rage or drama, but with quiet finality. There's grace in letting go when love becomes a battlefield. Choose solitude over dishonor... peace over performance.",
      "career_up_past": "Your career path has seen power struggles... perhaps a role where your voice was silenced or your talents overshadowed. This card reveals a time you compromised values for survival... a job you 'won' but hated deep down.",
      "career_up_present": "At work, tensions may be running high... someone wants to take credit, or maybe you're being pressured to prove your worth through competition. The environment is combative, and this card warns: don't lose yourself trying to 'win' a toxic game.",
      "career_up_future": "A future career challenge will test your ethics. A promotion may come at the expense of a colleague... or you'll be asked to sacrifice integrity to get ahead. Think carefully before accepting success built on someone else's fall.",
      "career_rev_past": "You once left a job or project that felt wrong... maybe it was meant to be a great opportunity, but it ended up draining you. That retreat still haunts your decisions today... making you hesitant to trust your ambition again.",
      "career_rev_present": "You may currently be in a workplace truce... but there's unease underneath. A rival or coworker is not as neutral as they seem. This isn't over... it's just waiting. Use this quiet time to prepare or distance yourself with intention.",
      "career_rev_future": "A career chapter is ending, not loudly but slowly... the writing is on the wall. Whether it's resignation or restructuring, you'll feel it before it hits. Don't resist the shift... it may free you from an invisible cage.",
      "finances_up_past": "You've made tough choices financially... perhaps gained something by taking from someone else, or walked away from a shared resource to protect yourself. The money came, but with guilt or loss attached.",
      "finances_up_present": "You might be in a financial disagreement... with a partner, a friend, or yourself. It's tempting to secure your own position, but fairness matters. Winning at all costs may cost more than you think.",
      "finances_up_future": "A risky financial decision may lead to short-term gain but long-term regret. Don't make decisions rooted in fear or dominance. Consider the emotional cost of wealth... and whether it's worth what you'll give up.",
      "finances_rev_past": "There was once a financial loss you tried to bury... maybe a failed investment, a debt you didn't acknowledge, or a financial betrayal swept under the rug. You survived, but a lesson was never truly processed.",
      "finances_rev_present": "Money might feel 'quiet' right now... but something's not sitting right. Perhaps you're ignoring an overdue payment, or letting someone handle finances who shouldn't. This isn't stability... it's avoidance.",
      "finances_rev_future": "The future may bring a necessary letting go... a financial loss that feels sad but strangely relieving. It's a closure of some kind... paying off a debt, ending a contract, or cutting ties with a draining financial partner.",
      "feelings_up_past": "Your emotional history is marked by suppressed rage or shame... someone hurt you, and you tried to rise above it. This card shows you may have buried that pain instead of processing it... and it quietly shaped your worldview.",
      "feelings_up_present": "You might be feeling defensive or sharp lately... protecting yourself before anyone can strike. The Five of Swords warns you're reacting from old wounds. Ask yourself if you're fighting a current battle or reliving an old one.",
      "feelings_up_future": "Emotions ahead will feel tense... but also clarifying. A falling out may happen, and it will sting. Yet it will leave behind a cleaner emotional space. Better to face the storm than bottle it up again.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "You buried emotional pain so deeply you forgot it existed... but it shaped you. A betrayal left you numb, and you convinced yourself it didn't matter. The numbness is what's still lingering today.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "Right now, you might be emotionally distant... choosing peace over truth. You're not angry, but you're not okay either. You've turned away from the fight, but you never really healed.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "A quiet emotional ending is on the horizon... not explosive, but deeply felt. You'll walk away not with bitterness, but with a strange kind of peace. There's sorrow in it... but also relief.",
      "actions_up_past": "In the past, you acted to defend yourself... maybe even aggressively. You didn't mean to hurt others, but in protecting yourself, you became the one who cut. It was survival, but it came at a cost.",
      "actions_up_present": "Right now, your actions may feel reactionary... pushing back before understanding the full picture. The card warns to pause... not every conflict requires a sword. Sometimes walking away is the stronger move.",
      "actions_up_future": "If you keep pushing forward without empathy, you'll win a fight but lose something dear. The future is asking for discernment... know when to strike, and when to let go. Be strategic, not destructive.",
      "actions_rev_past": "You once avoided conflict by walking away... it may have felt wise then, but it also left you haunted. You wonder now if you should've stood your ground. That silence still echoes in your choices.",
      "actions_rev_present": "You're currently holding back from taking action... afraid that stepping in will reignite something volatile. This inaction is understandable... but is it helping? Avoidance can sometimes be more damaging than confrontation.",
      "actions_rev_future": "Soon, you'll be faced with a situation where no action may be the best action. You'll choose not to engage, and in doing so, break a cycle. Peace won't come from control... it'll come from release."

It speaks of a journey by water, a chosen route, and an expedient shift... all guided with deliberate care. The imagery of the ferryman in a smooth course suggests you're crossing over from difficulty toward peace, not in haste, but with purpose.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "Drawn reversed, the Six of Swords carries a weighty stillness. Luck may feel elusive as truths are forced into the open. This card whispers of confession, publicity, and declarations... especially those that catch the heart off guard. Its symbolism now reverses the smooth passage... the journey is no longer external, but a confrontation with emotional exposure or unresolved intentions.",

      "interpretation_rev_future": "Expect a public revelation or emotional unveiling ahead. What's unsaid will find a way out, and it may change how others see you... or how you see yourself.",
      "love_up_past": "I feel the weight of an emotional crossing in your love life... like you once left behind a turbulent relationship or a phase of constant misunderstandings. That passage wasn't easy, but it was necessary. This card shows you made a conscious decision to seek peace over passion... still waters over stormy thrills.",
      "love_up_present": "There's a quiet movement in your heart now... maybe you're healing, maybe you're guiding someone else through emotional waters. A relationship is maturing or softening, and though the romance may not burn hot, there's a gentle depth forming... trust the process.",
      "love_up_future": "I sense you're heading toward a relationship that brings calm instead of chaos... the kind of love where silence is comfortable, and understanding flows unspoken. The journey might begin soon, or you're already halfway there without realizing it.",
      "love_rev_past": "There was a time when a confession, yours or theirs, shifted the ground beneath your relationship. Maybe someone spoke too soon or stayed silent too long. The result was vulnerability laid bare... and it still lingers in how you protect your heart.",
      "love_rev_present": "Something in your current love life is aching to be revealed. Whether it's a hidden desire, a withheld truth, or feelings you're denying, this moment calls for honesty. But beware... not all revelations are met with grace.",
      "love_rev_future": "A bold emotional declaration is on its way... either you'll say what you've been holding back, or someone will open their heart to you in an unexpected way. It may feel overwhelming, but clarity will follow if you meet it without fear.",
      "career_up_past": "I get the sense that you once walked away from a job, team, or professional space that drained you... the card suggests you didn't run, you planned. That shift gave you breathing space and mental recovery that still impacts how you work today.",

      "finances_rev_past": "There may have been a time when you revealed too much about your finances... maybe someone borrowed money, or maybe you trusted someone with financial info and got burned. That vulnerability taught you to be more guarded.",

      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Seven of Swords has entered your spread... and its energy is tricky, even unpredictable. Luck teeters on a fine edge, for this card whispers of bold attempts, secret hopes, and risky designs. Whether you're planning something clever or walking away from conflict, the outcome hangs in the balance. The image of the man stealing away with five swords while leaving two behind... suggests partial victory or unfinished business still looming.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "Reversed, the Seven of Swords presses pause on deception and calls attention to the power of truth. Luck leans toward revelation... whether through guidance, good advice, or unsolicited confessions. Still, beware of babbling tongues and slander... this card's proximity to a nearby camp hints that what's said in shadows may echo louder than expected.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "You may have once made a move in silence... perhaps you acted alone or against the grain. That moment still haunts you... not because it was wrong, but because it was only half-complete.",

      "interpretation_rev_present": "Now is the time to listen... truly listen. Someone near you is offering sincere guidance. But slander is also in the air, and you must learn to separate truth from noise.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "Soon, you'll receive advice or feedback that seems small... but it will be the key to defusing a major misunderstanding or public fallout. Ignore it, and the whispers may turn into accusations.",
      "love_up_past": "There's a lingering tension I feel from a past relationship... like someone wasn't telling the full truth. You or your partner may have tiptoed around emotional honesty, hoping to avoid conflict. That avoidance became the very root of distance.",
      "love_up_present": "Right now, something in your love life feels like a balancing act... maybe you're trying not to stir trouble, or maybe you're hiding how much you care. The risk is in not being seen clearly... deception, even when unintentional, leaves residue.",
      "love_up_future": "I sense an upcoming choice where your heart and your strategy won't align. Love may call for bold truth, but you might be tempted to hide your intent. If you want something real, you'll have to risk exposure.",
      "love_rev_past": "In a previous connection, someone gave you advice about your relationship... and you either ignored it or acted on it secretly. That moment became a pivot... not because of what was said, but because of what you chose to believe.",
      "love_rev_present": "You're being warned to look closely at who you trust in matters of the heart. Gossip and assumptions are distorting reality. Someone may be advising you... but what's their true motive?",

      "career_rev_past": "A past miscommunication or rumor may have caused friction at work. Maybe you were involved, maybe you were just nearby... either way, it taught you to tread carefully when words spread.",
      "career_rev_present": "Right now, solid advice could help steer you in a better direction professionally. But someone else may also be twisting facts for personal gain. Listen carefully... and don't repeat what you can't verify.",
      "career_rev_future": "In the near future, a mentor or peer will offer guidance that goes against the grain. It won't be popular advice, but it will be wise. Take it seriously... it could save you from public embarrassment.",

      "finances_up_present": "You may be planning something with your money that you're not sharing with others... a purchase, a stash, a secret save. Just be sure it's out of wisdom, not fear. Transparency has value too.",
      "finances_up_future": "A financial opportunity will come soon, but it'll require stealth or discretion. It might be a good deal... or it might be bait. Look twice before signing anything.",
      "finances_rev_past": "Someone once warned you about a financial risk... maybe you listened, maybe you didn't. But that advice changed your sense of caution and has shaped your spending habits ever since.",
      "finances_rev_present": "You may be hearing conflicting voices about how to manage your money. Look for the one that speaks from experience, not ego. And don't fall into the trap of oversharing your plans.",
      "finances_rev_future": "In the future, you'll be tempted to follow popular advice about investments or money... but the truth will be quieter. Listen for the voice that isn't shouting.",
      "feelings_up_past": "There's a past emotional wound tied to secrecy... maybe you hid how you felt for too long, or someone hid their feelings from you. That unspoken truth created distance that still echoes inside.",
      "feelings_up_present": "Emotionally, you're playing defense. Maybe you're not showing all your cards, or you're unsure who to trust with your truth. It's not wrong to protect your heart... but don't lock it away entirely.",
      "feelings_up_future": "A time is coming when you'll have to choose between guarding your emotions and expressing them. Hiding won't work forever... and the right person will respect your vulnerability.",
      "feelings_rev_past": "Someone once said something small, even a throwaway, that planted a seed of doubt or clarity in you. That emotional ripple still lingers in how you process feelings today.",
      "feelings_rev_present": "Your inner world is noisy with advice... maybe from friends, or just your own conflicting thoughts. To move forward emotionally, you'll need to sift through what's useful and discard what's fear-based.",
      "feelings_rev_future": "Soon, someone will say something that mirrors what you've been trying not to admit to yourself. Let it sink in... because it might be the key to emotional release.",

      "actions_up_present": "You're currently acting with precision... or secrecy. Strategy is fine, but make sure you're not cutting corners that will come back to haunt you later.",
      "actions_up_future": "A future move will require boldness... but also honesty. Don't just act smart... act aligned. If your actions reflect your truth, you'll avoid fallout.",

      "actions_rev_present": "You're being nudged to take action... but someone else's opinion is muddying your confidence. Step back and ask: whose voice am I really listening to?",
      "actions_rev_future": "In the near future, you'll feel pressure to act publicly... maybe even defend yourself. Stay grounded. One well-placed truth is more powerful than ten reactive gestures."

This is a card of entrapment... bad news, power in trammels, and the sting of crisis and censure. The image of the blindfolded woman surrounded by swords reveals the truth... you're confined, yes, but not destroyed. This imprisonment is temporary, shaped more by fear and perception than true defeat.",

Yet within this darkness lies truth... something unforeseen is stirring. The bondage is loosening, but what comes next may be unpredictable. That bound woman in the card? She may be preparing to rise... or fall.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "You've been through a time when everything felt constricted... like every move led to another wall. The crisis was real, but what truly held you in place was fear of what you couldn't see.",
      "interpretation_up_present": "Right now, you may feel trapped by something external... a situation, a rule, a person. But the real prison is in your perception. The blindfold can come off... but only if you're ready to face the truth.",

      "love_up_present": "Right now, you may feel emotionally bound in your relationship... or in the lack of one. There's a sense that love is out of reach, but it's not. You're blindfolded by old pain or self-doubt... and that illusion keeps real intimacy at bay.",
      "love_up_future": "You might soon face a relationship dilemma where every option seems wrong. The trap isn't your feelings... it's your belief that you're powerless. Love will ask you to make a bold move... even if your legs are trembling.",

You may be facing a dark night of the soul, where failure feels personal and dreams crumble into delay. The card's image is someone seated in agony beneath a looming wall of swords... connects to inner torment and mental anguish that feels all-consuming, though it may be rooted more in perception than absolute truth.",
      "interpretation_rev_intro": "Drawn in reverse, the Nine of Swords whispers of misfortune that clings like guilt... It is an unlucky sign filled with suspicion, shame, and fear thick enough to cage you. Here, the lament deepens into secrecy and self-condemnation. Its image of desolation becomes a prison of the mind... not always visible, but suffocating nonetheless.",
      "interpretation_up_past": "There was a time when sorrow consumed you so completely it felt eternal... The Nine of Swords upright suggests a past shaped by loss, betrayal, or inner collapse, where hope slipped through your fingers in silence.",

      "love_up_present": "A heavy sadness surrounds your heart now... The Nine of Swords suggests you're emotionally exhausted, either from a love that's falling apart or a deep loneliness that lingers even in company.

Yet through this night of tears, self-worth begins its slow return.",
      "love_rev_past": "The shame of past love still echoes... Maybe you were the one who hurt someone or let doubt eat away the bond. The reversed Nine of Swords here suggests you kept your sorrow quiet and hidden, trying to forget... but unresolved guilt still flickers in your memories.",

      "desc": "A prostrate figure, pierced by all the swords belonging to the card.",
      "interpretation_up_intro": "The Ten of Swords has arrived... a grim and piercing omen. This is a deeply unlucky draw, often signaling pain, affliction, and utter sadness. The image of a figure pinned by ten swords evokes a moment where the worst has already happened... a desolation so total it leaves no illusions behind.

      "interpretation_rev_present": "Though the shadows are thick around you, something is shifting... the Ten of Swords reversed now means you're rising. Temporary victories are appearing, small wins after a long battle. But be mindful... these gains must be nurtured or they'll vanish like mist.",
      "interpretation_rev_future": "A window of power opens ahead... the reversed Ten of Swords suggests that favor or success is coming your way, but only for a short while.

      "love_up_past": "There's a sharp ache around your heart... I feel it strongly, like a wound that once defined your entire emotional story.

It didn't heal you fully... but it gave you space to breathe and grow stronger.",
      "love_rev_present": "A shift is happening in your heart space... something that once devastated you is losing its power. You may be slowly recovering from heartbreak or regaining control over your emotions. This isn't bliss yet... but it's relief, like sunlight returning after a long storm.",
      "love_rev_future": "I sense a fragile hope returning to your love life... but it's laced with caution.

      "actions_up_future": "Soon you'll have to make a painful choice... one that ends a cycle of overgiving. Your actions must align with your healing, not your guilt. It may hurt... but it will free you.",
